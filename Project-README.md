ABOUT THE CHALLENGE:
Lorem Ipsum


MY APPROACH:
I started out by going through the user stories and writing out the classes necessary to satisfy the task requirements, as well as the actions those classes would need to perform (see ./docs/user_stories.md). This allowed me to have a solid overview of the bare-bones functionality this project required before writing any code. (Similar to how we wrote out the nouns and verbs for the user stories in Boris Bikes, except more focused on the nouns and verbs actually relevant to the code). The next step was simply to set up doc and spec files for each class and then go through the actions necessary to have a funcitoning airport step by step, writing tests for each action and then making the tests pass.
