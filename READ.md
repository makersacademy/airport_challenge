#Airport challenge

In this challenge we were asked to build an airport that would allow planes to land and takeoff. Further, we wanted to grant air traffic control the abilities to not let the plane land in an airport if it was full.

When trying to integrate weather into the equation and allow stormy weather to prohibit take_off and landing, I got stuck finding the syntax to pass a specific number through my random number generator. Therefore, I was unable to integrate this feature into the airport class and those tests.
