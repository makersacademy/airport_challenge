This is my individual project challenge for Week 3 of the Makers Apprenticeship program. The task at hand was to develop a programme which emulates an air traffic control system. Planes would be able to take-off and land at an airport at the command of an air traffic controller; on some occasions, if the weather is stormy, the airport would have to prevent any planes from moving in or out of the aiport. 

The objectives of this project are to become comfortable with the use of Test-Driven Development (TDD) as well as writing elegant code.
