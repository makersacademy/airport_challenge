Airport Challenge


The purpose of this project was to develop a software system for an airport that allows planes to land and take off at the airport.

This project was designed in fulfilment of the Makers Academy week 1 challenge.

I effectively utilised Test Driven Development methods and procedures throughout this project.

The program developed allows planes to land and takeoff from the said airport. It also checks for "stormy weather" and either refuses or allows landing and takeoff based on the weather status.
