# Airport Challenge [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/travis-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gtormiston/airport_challenge)

Makers Academy week 1 challenge testing TDD skills in Ruby and RSpec.

## User stories to domain model

- plane land 
- plane confirm landed
- plane take off 
- confirm not docked (airborne)

- airport land plane
- airport confirm plane landed (airport or plane?? perhaps a plane method)
- airport release plane
- airport confirm plane not docked (airport or plane??)
- airport prevent takeoff if stormy
- airport prevent landing if stormy
- airport prevent landing if full
- airport have default capacity that can be overriden

The weather needs to be generated at random numerically, but should be mostly sunny. Use a `rand` on a `range` between 1-10 and if number is less than 2 it equals "stormy".

## Classes

Two main classes for Plane and Airport, plus a Weather class for generating random weather to keep it seperate from the other classes.

## assumptions

- airport is empty at the beginning of the session
- a plane instance is airborne when created (i.e. approaching from another airport)
