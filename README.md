Task
-----

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  


How the program functions:

1) It can land planes
2) It allows planes to take-off
3) It has a variable capacity for planes
4) It reports the status of planes


Problems faced:

- How the airport responds to Stormy Weather
