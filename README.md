Airport Challenge
=================

This programme allows planes to land at and take off from airports. Planes can only take off from airports they are in. If the weather is stormy (a rare occurance) the planes can neither land nor take off.

I created the Plane, Airport and Weather and used TDD to satisfy the user stories.
