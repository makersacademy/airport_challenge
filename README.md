Airport Challenge
=================

Outline
---------

Airport Challenge was the weekend challenge set after our first week at Makers Academy. It aimed to consolidate our understanding of Test-Driven Development and Red-Green-Refactoring, after working on a similar project during the week. I approached this challenge knowing that I wanted to be strict when it came to the order in which I was testing and writing code. I made sure that I ran a feature test before writing the unit test, then made sure that the unit test passed before moving on. I definitely used irb a great deal to test my code was doing what I wanted it to do.

The user stories that our code had to comply with were as follows:

```
As a pilot
So that I can arrive at my specified destination
I would like to land my plane at the appropriate airport

As a pilot
So that I can set off for my specified destination
I would like to be able to take off from the appropriate airport

As an air traffic controller
So that I can avoid collisions
I want to be able to prevent airplanes landing when the airport if full

As an air traffic controller
So that I can avoid accidents
I want to be able to prevent airplanes landing or taking off when the weather is stormy
```
