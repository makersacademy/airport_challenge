All tests are passing as per Travis CI
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/makersacademy/airport_challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/makersacademy/airport_challenge)

My Approach:
There were 6 user stories for this challenge. I started off by building a new airport which is what will be giving the commands to the planes to land or take off. The Plane classes accept only a couple commands and pretty much echo if they are landed or not landed. The weather class only gives the random weather report which is called by the airport. This can be changed pretty simply if a real weather report is wanted. All tests pass and testing coverage is slightly higher than 97%. The only thing that isn't covered is the weather class and despite all my efforts, I was unable to figure out a way to test this and get 100% coverage. I've changed all suggestions that the hound brought up.
