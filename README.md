Task
-----

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

User story 1
```
As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination 
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport
```
I wanted to make two tests, one that would instruct the plane 
to land and another to raise an error if the plane had already landed. I had difficulty writing the exact code needed to pass these tests and calling classes in methods. To complete the task applying the AAA method with the extracted verbs and nous from each user story.
