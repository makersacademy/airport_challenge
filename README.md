## Challenge Synopsis
Write a Ruby program that resembles the Air-Traffic Control system of an airport.

Planes can only land or take-off when weather is good, so apart from writing a program that controls the plane flow in and out of the airport, we also need to randomise weather.

Also to assist the adoption of the program in random airports, we need to have the ability to scale up the airport.
