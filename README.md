For this challenge I tried to keep things as simple as possible and trying to follow instructions step by step.

I started with feature tests to start building classes/methods that satisfied the user stories. I then moved to unit tests.

In my code, 'Airport' class had all the methods. If I was to do it all over again, I would try to define methods #land and #take_off inside 'Plane' class.

I have created a feature_spec file to run feature tests without having to do it manually every time.

I know I should have done a better job for testing edge cases but all tests are passing and I'm getting 100% coverage.
