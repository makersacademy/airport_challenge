Solving the challenge
---------------------

```
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport and confirm that it has landed

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
```

I first chose to give the responsibility of landing and taking_off to the Plane class. However as I did not find a way to keep track of the number of planes present in the airport, without the Plane class having too much information on the Airport class, I made the decision to start from scratch and give the responsibility of landing and taking of to the Airport class.
