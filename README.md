In the spirit of practicing what was learned this week in the Boris Bike challenge, my flow control included raising errors as guard conditions. It was only really when I got to writing a full final feature test script that I realised this made life a lot more difficult in that regard, and some googling suggested that raising errors is generally not good practice as part of inevitable flow control. This caused my eventual feature test to be a bit more complex than it needed to be, but it was useful to learn a little about error handling with begin/rescure.

I also slightly struggled with using puts/print to feature test - for example, when testing Airport.land, rspec wouldn't allow me to check output to console from within an it block; when I removed the it block, rspec wouldn't allow me to use 'allow' WITHOUT it being inside an it block, so I was in a catch 22 there. I couldn't figure out a way round it, so I had to live with just returning strings rather than printing them to the console. In terms of functionality, this is the only aspect of my program I ended up being unhappy with. 

Generally, as I discovered during the week, using TDD to guide my coding feels much more natural and logical when starting a new project from scratch with some TDD knowledge already in place. Simply moving through each user story with TDD was a great tool for having my next coding step almost handed to me. I did forget a couple of times though - I added some initialize methods without thinking, before writing tests for them first.
