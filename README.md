How to use it
---------

'airport.rb', 'weather.rb', and 'plane.rb' are all required in order for the application to function.

Creating an Airport Object

An airport object contains two instance variables:
        @hangar is an empty array which is used to store Plane objects
        @capacity is the total capacity permitted for Plane objects. It default to Airport::DEFAULT_CAPACITY by default.
