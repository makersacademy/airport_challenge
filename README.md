## Introduction

The airport app will allow planes to take off and to land in different airports depending on the weather conditions.  
If the weather it's stormy the planes are not allowed to fly.  
I'm building this app to practise working with the  TDD(Test Driven Development) approach. It will also help me getting more insight into the rspec sintax and getting used to working with it.

## Technologies

Ruby 2.6.0

## Launch

Will need help filling out this field.  
To be completed.

## Project Status

Work in progress:

* README file being updated as i get through  
  my client story
* "airport_spec.rb" created
* "airport.rb" created
* Project is in a GREEN state passing rspec and rubocop
