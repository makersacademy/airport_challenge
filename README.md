# Airport Challenge #

Program to control the flow of planes at an airport. The program is broken down into 3 distinct files/classes:

* **Airport (airport.rb)** - The main program which controls the takeoff and landing of planes.

* **Plane (plane.rb)** - Responds to takeoff and landing, and stores the current airport.

* **Weather (weather.rb)** - Randomly generates a current weather state.
