## Status ##

### Completed user stories: ###
```
  As an air traffic controller
  So I can get passengers to a destination
  I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport and confirm that it has landed
```

  As an air traffic controller
  So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
  I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport
```
### Attempted user stories: ###
```
  As an air traffic controller
  To ensure safety
  I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

I successfully created and tested a random weather generator, but ran out of time trying to get it to interact with airport. My main struggle was trying to stub out the randomness in my weather tests successfully.  

### Not attempted: ###
```
  As an air traffic controller
  To ensure safety
  I want to prevent landing when the airport is full
```
```
  As the system designer
  So that the software can be used for many different airports
  I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
```
## How to Use ##

```sh
irb
require './lib/airport.rb'
plane = Plane.new
airport = Airport.new
airport.land(plane) #lands the given plane at the airport
airport.planes #returns landed planes
airport.take_off(plane) #the given plane will take off from the airport.
