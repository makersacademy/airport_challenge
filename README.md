# North's Airport Challenge

notes:
  1.) #stormy? test for boolean return value relies on many runs likely to produce at least one 'true' value. I don't really know how to use the rspec mocking syntax, I didn't get that far during the week. But I will try to write a double if I get the rest of the user stories covered.

  2,) feature_test.rb is pretty useless right now.
