Airport challenge
---------

* Able to instruct planes to land and take off
* Can confirm landing and taking off
* Prevent landing or taking off during bad weather
* Will not allow planes to land if airport is full


Instructions
-------

A new airport can be created by calling new on the Airport class (Airport.new)

A new plane can be created by calling new on the Plane class (Plane.new)

To check how many planes are at the airport, you can call the empty? method on the new Airport instance

To land a plane you must call land() method on the airport instance

The weather is randomly generated and can either be sunny (good to fly / take off) or stormy (no flying / taking off)

To take off, the take_off method needs to be called on the airport instance - weather is randomly generated
