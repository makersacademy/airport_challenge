Airport challenge task overview
-----

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

```

I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport and confirm that it has landed

As an air traffic controller

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
```
