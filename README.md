## Airport Challenge
=================

Enables an air traffic controller to manage a plane to take off and land in airports if the capacity of the airport and the weather allows it.


```

## Details
---------

* tested using TDD and rspec
* Ruby language (version 2.4)
* Did not follow the user stories in order, but have commented in each unit test which user story it refers to.
* Completed all user stories, however struggled using doubles and stubs and did not have time to use them in this challenge.
* Referred to Boris_bikes repo for help

how app is used from users perspective in irb:

2.4.0 :001 > require "./lib/airport"
 => true
2.4.0 :002 > airport = Airport.new
 => #<Airport:0x007f9e7681c8d0 @capacity=500, @planes=[]>
2.4.0 :003 > plane = Plane.new
 => #<Plane:0x007f9e778198f0>
2.4.0 :004 > airport.land_in_airport(plane)
 => [#<Plane:0x007f9e778198f0>]
2.4.0 :005 > plane2 = Plane.new
 => #<Plane:0x007f9e770055b0>
2.4.0 :006 > airport.land_in_airport(plane2)
 => [#<Plane:0x007f9e778198f0>, #<Plane:0x007f9e770055b0>]
2.4.0 :007 > airport.weather?
 => "ok weather"
2.4.0 :008 > airport.leave_airport
 => #<Plane:0x007f9e770055b0>

 user sets capacity to "2" can only land 2 planes into the airport:

 2.4.0 :001 > require "./lib/airport.rb"
 => true
2.4.0 :002 > airport = Airport.new(2)
 => #<Airport:0x007f8cf10de050 @capacity=2, @planes=[]>
2.4.0 :003 > plane = Plane.new
 => #<Plane:0x007f8cf10a5458>
2.4.0 :004 > airport.land_in_airport(plane)
 => [#<Plane:0x007f8cf10a5458>]
2.4.0 :005 > plane2 = Plane.new
 => #<Plane:0x007f8cf104fb20>
2.4.0 :006 > airport.land_in_airport(plane2)
 => [#<Plane:0x007f8cf10a5458>, #<Plane:0x007f8cf104fb20>]
2.4.0 :007 > plane3 = Plane.new
 => #<Plane:0x007f8cf102d188>
2.4.0 :008 > airport.land_in_airport(plane3)
RuntimeError: Airport is full
