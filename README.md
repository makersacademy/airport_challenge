=================
Steps taken/theory:

1. Functional representation of user stories.
2. Built the first structures using take_of and landing method in airport class.
3. Rebuilt the structure again to try and follow the premise of single risponsibility.

4. Acounted for edge cases, but found myself over complicating the process.
5. Realised that stubbing and mocking shouldnt be used in all tests after I'd done them all
6. The program is functional but yet dense, will learn from this.
