Aim of the program
---------
Write a program that helps with the air traffic control of planes at an airport.
Classes have been created to satisfy all the user stories. A random number generator has been used to set the weather (it is normally sunny but on rare occasions it may be stormy). Stubs and doubles have been used in the tests to override random weather and to ensure consistent test behaviour.

## Notes on test coverage

```sh
