This simple terminal app which enables air traffic controller and system designer to control flows of planes at an airport. It allows planes to land and take off during good weathers so passengers will be safe.


Features
---------
- [x] Allow plane to land and take off from the airport
- [x] Confirm plane status (whether they have landed or taken off)
- [x] Prevent planes to land or take off during stormy weathers (pending)
- [x] Ensure planes that had taken off are not in airport and planes that have landed cannot land again
- [x] Enable default capacity to be set

2.2.3 :001 > require './lib/airport'
 => true
2.2.3 :002 > airport = Airport.new
 => #<Airport:0x007ffa998aa7c8 @planes=[], @capacity=10, @weather_today=#<Weather:0x007ffa998aa6b0 @weather=7>>
2.2.3 :003 > plane001 = Plane.new
