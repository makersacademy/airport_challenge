It has three classes, Airport, Plane and Weather
The weather raises "Can't take off :(" if it is stormy.  In the tests it kept returning an the error message from below when I tired to set the weather to a certain condidition so they kept randomly passing and failing. I couldn't sort it out so in the end I commented it out so the other features woudld work

WARNING: An expectation of `:stormy?` was set on `nil`. To allow expectations on `nil` and suppress this message, set `config.allow_message_expectations_on_nil` to `true`. To disallow expectations on `nil`, set `config.allow_message_expectations_on_nil` to `false`. Called from /Users/elizabethwicks/Documents/Makers/airport/airport_challenge/spec/airport_spec.rb:17:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'.
