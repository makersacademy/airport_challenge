This challenge required the building of a program to emulate the flow of Planes at airports.
The program was built from the user stories below. 

User Stories

To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

Improvements

I believe the program requires further development surrounding 'edge-cases'.
An example of this is that in its current state, a plane can be landed to multiple airports at the same time.
