Airport Challenge
=================

This repo has been created for the Week 1 Friday Ronin Challenge "Airport Challenge".

The challenge is to create and test drive a Ruby program which simulates the landing and take off of planes at an airport.

This challenge is based on the Week 1 Ronin Challenge entitled "Boris Bikes" and my approach to the airport challenge will be based on this.

The Airport Challenge instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge).
