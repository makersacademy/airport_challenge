Airport Challenge
=================

This is my solution to the Makers Academy Airport Challenge, as described in https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge.

The task was to 'test drive the creation of a set of classes/modules' to satisfy the given user stories. To do this I split the user stories into objects and messsages and matched to corresponding classes and methods. I used TDD to test my modules, unit testing using Rspec and feature testing in IRB. I created the following modules:

* Airport class
* Plane class 
* Weather class
