# Project Title

Airport Challenge - Makers Academy

## Description

The task is to write the software to respond to user stories about the control of planes landing and taking off at an airport.

NB: My at_airport? method needs work as it doesn't compare the plane object passed with the planes array.

## Running the tests

For testing, require feature_spec.rb

#require './spec/feature_spec.rb'

In this file there are also variables set up to get you going:

w = Weather.new
a = Airport.new
p0 = Plane.new
p1 = Plane.new
p2 = Plane.new
a.land(p0,w)
a.land(p1,w)
a.land(p2,w)
a.planes.count
