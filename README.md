Introduction

Evaluated what the domain model was based on the various user stories. Established that initially there needed to be two classes; one for airport and one for plane.

With regards to the first few messages between the airport and plane, I decided to place the methods of takeoff and land in the airport class because it has to give permission. Although there is a valid argument to place these methods in the plane class.

Working through the various user stories, I established the individual unit test by breaking the user requirement into small components. User Red, Green, refactor I completed the necessary functionality.

The Rspec testing contains doubles to mimic the weather module without the inherent randomisation.
