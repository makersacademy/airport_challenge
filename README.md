Airport Challenge
=================

Airport: controls the airport behaviour. It can allow or reject planes to land
and take off depending on the weather.

Plane: controls the planes behavior. This is a small class which tracks the
planes flying state.

Weather: is a module which picks a number at random and returns the weather
accordingly. This module is used in the airport class.

Task
-----

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client.
