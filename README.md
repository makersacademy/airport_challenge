Airport Challenge
=================
This is my beginnigns of creating a functioning airport.

To start with the airpornt needs to ba able to land planes. I have enabled this with the land_plane method which allows planes to touch down if there is space available. If there is not space available there will be an error message highlighting this.

The airport needs to be allow planes to take off which I have done with the take_off method. Once a plane has taken off the airport will remove that plane and therefore create space for another plane to land.
