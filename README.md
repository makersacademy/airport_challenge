Airport Challenge
=================

### My approach: ###

To complete this project, I decided to make the classes "Airport" and "Plane," with the module "ATC" which stands for Air Traffic Control.

The majority of my methods were within the module, including; land_plan, confirm_take_off, confirm_weather_descent. The Airplane class was used to confirm airplane capacity/population and the Plane class helped initialise the program.

I attempted to focus on the RSPEC framework when completing this project. I also enjoyed utilising IRB to test the flow of the program. I hope these both show.

#### Initial Instructions ####


To start the program, please go into the "completed airport challenge" folder, followed by the lib folder via the command line. Enter into IRB on the plane.rb file (irb -r ./plane.rb) to play. From here, the instructions should be able to guide you through.

RSPEC testing: You should be able to see these results by typing rspec inside the airport_challenge_complete folder.

I hope you enjoy!
