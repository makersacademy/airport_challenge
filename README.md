### Week 1 Weekend Task
## Airport Challenge

To complete this challenge I will fulfil the client's request for software
to control the flow of planes to and from and airport, I will be using TDD
to build the appropriate classes, modules and methods.

I will use a methodical approach using a following procedure:

1. Feature test
2. Unit test - which will fail
3. Write the simplest code to make the test pass
4. Repeat with another test
