# Makers Academy Airport Challenge
### Weekend challenge, week 1

Building on OOP work carried out throughout the week, this challenge required those taking it to translate a series of user stories into code. The challenge was based around creating airport and plane objects, the latter of which would be able to take off and land, and the former of which would have capacities to accept certain numbers of planes.   

This task built on similar work we had done throughout the week, designing a system of bikes, docking stations, vans, and repair shops to mirror London's Boris Bikes system. The full instructions for the airport challenge can be found in [instructions.md]().
