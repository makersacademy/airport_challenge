Airport Challenge

For each user story — although I thought I had the division of objects and messages clearly mapped out in my head — I still went ahead and sketched out the functional representations and domain models. It was obvious then that things weren't so clear.

I had a false start due to indecision with placement and arrangement of my methods.

As a result of that initial uncertainty the arrangement I eventually went with has a small niggle in that airport.take_off is not the most logical looking piece of code. I even considered adding otherwise unneeded code to make it read better, but was and still am unsure what the lesser of the two evils are — a small cognitive leap, or excess code.
