About our software
---------

This amazing software has been built for the Heathrow airport in order to help control the flow of planes. It has been adopted by plenty of other airports all around the world (hope everything will be fine) since then !
The software allows the air traffic controller to intruct the landing or take off of different planes from various airports. He can also set a default capacity to adapt the size of the airport. 

Still in production
-----

Although the whole code is working fine and has been tested successsfully, we are sorry but the software is not ready to be sold yet ! We still have to prevent landing of our planes when the weather is too stormy and run more tests afterwards !
Besides, our weather forecast is not as accurate as we wanted it to be, we will figure it out soon !
