## About

This my own version of the airport challenge for week 1 in Makers Academy.

## My approach

I started by doing first a very simple implementation, but I felt like I wasn't following best practices. I asked feedback from someone who has more experience than me, and followed their advice. I went through again this week's materials, and read more about rspec. In this version I added the AirportController Class, which in my opionion is not nessecary needed, but I think this way my program design is cleaner, and more understandable. I also changed the error's strings to constants, and added an rng to the Weather class.
