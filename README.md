Thinking

```
As a pilot
So that I can arrive at my specified destination
I would like to land my plane at the appropriate airport

As a pilot
So that I can set off for my specified destination
I would like to be able to take off from the appropriate airport

As an air traffic controller
So that I can avoid collisions
I want to be able to prevent airplanes landing when the airport if full

As an air traffic controller
So that I can avoid accidents
I want to be able to prevent airplanes landing when the weather is stormy

These four user stories can be delivered in three feature tests:
  'all planes can land and all planes can take off'
  'a plane cannot land when an airport is full'
  'planes cannot land when the weather is stormy'
