In order to be successful at this project, my code **MUST**:
- [x] Instruct a plane to land at the airport.
- [x] Instruct a plane to take off from the airport.
- [x] Confirm that the departed plane(s) are no longer at the airport.
- [?]  Prevent departures and landings when the weather is "stormy".
- [x]  Prevent arrivals when the airport is full.
- [?]  Set a default airport capacity that can be overridden as necessary.
