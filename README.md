The task
---------

This is my response to the first weekend challenge at Makers Academy, to build an airport application in Ruby based on six user stories, using a TDD approach with RSpec. The airport should enable a plane to take off and land at an airport, depending on whether or not the weather is stormy, and the airport should have a default capacity that can be overridden when required.

This is a demonstration of how the app is used in full with an irb transcript:

```

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
```

Edge cases
---------

* Planes can only take off from airports they are already in

* Planes that are already flying cannot take off or be in an airport

* Planes that are landed cannot land again and must be in an airport
