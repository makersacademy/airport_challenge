#Airport Challenge

This is my solutions for the [airport challenge](https://github.com/michaellennox/airport_challenge) carried out while at Makers' Academy.

##How I worked

I aimed to complete this challenge in a test driven manner, using manual feature tests within irb and automated unit tests with rspec. I would convert each individual user story into a failing manual feature test and then work on each individual segment as a new failing unit test. I have aimed to [commit every test cycle](https://github.com/michaellennox/airport_challenge/commits/master) so you can so my process.

I have tried to encapsulate my code as much as possible throughout and the end user should only ever be interacting with an instance of the Airport class.
