Task
-----

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.

Approach
---------

* I have tried not to overcomplicate the early user stories, leaving the edge cases until the program is more fleshed out
*
