## Makers Academy Airport Challenge

### What it does

A simple program managing airports, airplanes and their taking off and landing dependent on the weather. 

### How I will complete this 

In the first weekend challenge, I will be using what I've learned in the Precourse and Week 1 of Makers to complete this challenge and try to implement good programming practices in this exercise.
