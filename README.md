I plan to do my best to make very little baby steps while working on this project.
I plan to follow the steps we used to complete challenges during the week.
I will write very detailed explanation of what I do, mainly for myself. When I feel more comfartable, explanation probably will become less detailed.

I followed the user story, also read the Task in details, used most of the proposed tests, wrote several additional tests, have not made any new classes (was not sure I will be able to handle them), or new modules(do not think that planes and airports are so similar, on this stage could be more confusuion). Main thing was RGR of course.

Travis passed.

![alt text] (https://travis-ci.org/Proskurina/airport_challenge.svg?branch=master)


Below is very detailed explanation of what I did. No need to read. For myself mostly.

--------

######Started to work on the first piece of the user story.

1. First I organised the nouns and verbs into Objects and Messages

 |Objects 			|Messages						|Comments		|
 |	----			|			----				|		----	|
 |Pilot				|								|				|
 |Destination 		|								|(same as airoport?)|
 |Plane				|land - appropriate airport		|not sure about use of appropriate airoport yet|
 |Airport 			|								|					|

 Conclusion - probably will start to work from Plane class.

2. Out of interest I run rspec on existing tests. Received very interesting result that all tests were skipped, read about pending examples.

3. I read existing tests for Plane class.

 xit 'is flying when created' - seems to be to early for this test.

 As I understand from the Task and the contest ot the user story, a plane can be either flying or landed. So the plane should respond to flying? first.

 This is my starting point.

4. First test.

 4.1. Feature test in irb

 ```
 :001 > plane = Plane.new
 => #<Plane:0x007f919a0e72d8>
 :002 > plane.flying?
 NoMethodError: undefined method `flying?' for #<Plane:0x007f919a0e72d8>
	from (irb):2
	from /Users/yana/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
 :003 >
 ```

 Does not respond to flying? yet.

 4.2. Wrote the test, made it fail.

 4.3 Wrote empty method flying? in Plane. Now the test pass. A plane responds to flying?

 4.4. Commited the changes, pushed them to github

 4.5. Had some problems with Markdown in README, added it to README, commited, pushed, now it looks nicer.

5. Now I think it is time for the test xit 'is flying when created'

 5.1. Feature test in irb

 ```
 :001 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007fb0e98ffe20>
 :002 > plane.flying?
  => nil
 :003 >
 ```

 Expected true, got nil.

 5.2. Wrote the test, made it fail.

 5.3. Now I have several options to write a code.

 First, I can just make flying? always return true, it will make the test pass (I checked!).
 Second, I can write something more complicated involving writing method initialize and introducing new variable @status = true, and make flying? return status. Probably there are other better options. At this stage decided to take the first approach and see what happens next.

 Now the test passed.

 5.4. Commited, pushed.

6. Now back to the first piece of the user story. Time to teach the plane to land.

 6.1. Feature test in irb

 ```
 :001 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007fb982002920>
 :002 > plane.land
 NoMethodError: undefined method `land' for #<Plane:0x007fb982002920>
	from (irb):2
	from /Users/yana/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
 :003 >
 ```
 Does not land yet.

 6.2. Wrote the test, made it fail

 6.3. Wrote an empty method land in Plane, now the test pass.

 6.4. Commited, pushed.

7. Now it is time to think about status landed?

 7.1. Feature irb test

 ```
 :001 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007fb2b398b940>
 :002 > plane landed?
 NoMethodError: undefined method `landed?' for main:Object
	from (irb):2
	from /Users/yana/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
 :003 >
 ```
 7.2. Wrote the test, made it fail

 7.3. Wrote empty method landed? in Plane. Now the test pass.

 7.4. As a refactoring stage had a thought that may be methods should be not #flying? and #landed?, but one method #status returning 'flying' or 'landed'. Decided to stick to the logic of boris_bikes for now.

 7.5. Commited, pushed.

8. Plane should be landed after landing. It also means that plane should not be landed before landing (otherwise we can not be sure that #land actually landed the plane, may be it was olready landed). I do not know if it is possible to check status of a subject before calling particular method (it seems strange). So I need another way to check that a plane is not landed before landing. Decided to start from the fact that a new plane is flying (so was not landed), new plane should not be landed.

 8.1. Feature test in irb

 ```
 :001 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007faff28c6938>
 :002 > plane.landed?
  => nil
 :003 >
 ```
 Expected to be false, got nil.

 8.2. Wrote the test, made it fail.

 8.3. Connected landed with flying (when landed not flying). Test pass.

 8.4. Commited, pushed.

9. Now it makes more sense to check that plane is landed after landing.

 9.1. Feature test in irb

 ```
 :001 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007fe4ba9a00f0>
 :002 > plane.landed?
  => false
 :003 > plane.land
  => nil
 :004 > plane.landed?
  => false
 :005 >
 ```
 Expected to get true, got false

 9.2. Wrote the test, made it fail.

 9.3. Wrote some code, made the test pass. At a refactor stage thought about introducing attr_accessor to get rid of @, decided not to.

 9.4. Commited, pushed.

10. I think that main requirements from the first piece of the user story are covered now, except for an appropriate airport. Returnd to point 1, thought about "a diagram that shows how your Objects will use Messages to communicate with one another". Still not sure about appropriate airport (argument for landed? but what for? Return of landed? Again, what for?). Decided to move to the second piece of the user story and come back to the issue with an appropriate airport later.

######Started to work on the second piece of the user story.

1. Make a plane to be able to take off from an appropriate airport

 1.1. Feature test in irb

 ```
 :001 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007fc1cb9ba520 @flying=true>
 :002 > plane.take_off
 NoMethodError: undefined method `take_off' for #<Plane:0x007fc1cb9ba520 @flying=true>
	from (irb):2
	from /Users/yana/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
 :003 >
 ```

 1.2. Wrote the test, made it fail

 1.3. Wrote an empty #take_off, test passed.

 1.4. Commited, pushed

2. Make a plane flying after take off. Means plane should land first.

 2.1. Feature test in irb

 ```
 :001 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007ff32999e8b8 @flying=true>
 :002 > plane.land
  => false
 :003 > plane.flying?
  => false
 :004 > plane.take_off
  => nil
 :005 > plane.flying?
  => false
 :006 >
 ```

 Expected to be true, got false.

 2.2. Wrote the test, made it fail.

 2.3. Wrote some code, test passed.

 2.4. Commited, pushed.

3. Except for 'an appropriate airport' thing, I think I have finished the second piece of the user story.

######Started to work on the third piece of the user story.

1. So now to the Airport class. Prevent landing when the airport is full seems to early. First should set up basic functionality of the airport. Starting with plane take_off.

 1.1. Feature test

 ```
 :001 > airport = Airport.new
  => #<Airport:0x007fb2528f74e0>
 :002 > airport.take_off
 NoMethodError: undefined method `plane_take_off' for #<Airport:0x007fb2528f74e0>
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/yana/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
 :003 >

 ```

 1.2. Wrote test, made it fail.

 1.3. Wrote empty method, test passed.

 1.4. Commited, pushed.

2. plane_take_off should instruct plane to #take_off. I need a plane for that, either as an argument, or one of the planes, already in the airport. So a plane should land first.

 2.1 Feature test

 ```
 :001 > airport = Airport.new
  => #<Airport:0x007f9b731653f8>
 :002 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007f9b73156fb0 @flying=true>
 :003 > airport.plane_landing(plane)
 NoMethodError: undefined method `plane_landing' for #<Airport:0x007f9b731653f8>
  from (irb):3
  from /Users/yana/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
 :004 >
 ```

 2.2. Wrote test, made it fail.

 2.3.Wrote empty method with argument plane, test passed.

 2.4. Commited, pushed

3. Now plane shoul be instructed to land.

 3.1 Feature test

 ```
 :001 > airport = Airport.new
  => #<Airport:0x007fa3340d16f8>
 :002 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007fa3340c2590 @flying=true>
 :003 > airport.plane_landing(plane)
  => nil
 :005 > plane.landed?
  => false
 ```

Expexted to be true.

 3.2. Wrote test, used double the first time. I test that the plane receives message land. Made the test fail.

 3.3. Wrote some code, the test passed. Checked that everything works in irb also (as the test was with double).

 3.4. Commited, pushed


4.0 Now airport should receive a plane, and I think it should not lose it after the plane is received. So before receiving a plane, I should make a place where planes will be kept, I add initialize to Airport, and set var 'planes' to an empty array and add respective attr_reader. We do not test initialize. So after this step aiport is ready to receive planes.

 4.1. Feature test

 ```
 :001 > airport = Airport.new
  => #<Airport:0x007fdc3c1acf50 @planes=[]>
 :002 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007fdc3c19da50 @flying=true>
 :003 > airport.plane_landing(plane)
  => false
 :004 > airport.planes
 => []
 ```

 Expect planes to include plane.

 4.2. Wrote test, made it fail.

 4.3. Wrote some code, the test pass.

5.0 Now to another thing airoport does - instructs a plain to take off. Now the question is should airport send a message to take off to a particular plane, or whoever is first in a queue? At this point I decided that airport will send message to take off to the first in a queue, and the first in a queue is the first landed (so the first(zeroth) in an array). Will start with sending the message.

 5.1. Feature test

 ```
 :001 > airport = Airport.new
  => #<Airport:0x007ffe011ace38 @planes=[]>
 :002 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007ffe0119d898 @flying=true>
 :003 > airport.plane_landing(plane)
  => [#<Plane:0x007ffe0119d898 @flying=false>]
 :004 > airport.plane_take_off
  => nil
 :005 > plane.flying?
  => false
  ```

 Expect plane to receive message take_off, so expect it to be flying

 5.2. Wrote test, used double again. I test that the plane receives message take_off. Made the test fail.

 5.3. Wrote some code, the test pass.

 5.4. Commit.

6.0 Airport should release a plane when it takes off.

 6.1. Feature test

 ```
 :001 > airport = Airport.new
  => #<Airport:0x007fce4906f878 @planes=[]>
 :002 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007fce488d0ce8 @flying=true>
 :003 > airport.plane_landing(plane)
  => [#<Plane:0x007fce488d0ce8 @flying=false>]
 :004 > airport.plane_take_off
  => true
 :005 > airport.planes
  => []
 :006 >
 ```

 WOW! I expected it to be empty and it is empty!
 And that is correct because to send a message to take off I need a plane, and I used shift method to take a plane from planes array.
 So now the question is should I change my code and first just to send a message to a plane to take off, and only then release it? At this point I think that I will do this.

 6.2. Changed the code slightly, checked that all tests still pass.

 6.3. Now feature test looks like this

 ```
 :001 > airport = Airport.new
  => #<Airport:0x007fc23308e420 @planes=[]>
 :002 > plane = Plane.new
  => #<Plane:0x007fc23307f010 @flying=true>
 :003 > airport.plane_landing(plane)
  => [#<Plane:0x007fc23307f010 @flying=false>]
 :004 > airport.plane_take_off
  => true
 :005 > airport.planes
  => [#<Plane:0x007fc23307f010 @flying=true>]
 :006 >
 ```

 So, expect to airport.planes to be one plane less, then before the release.

 6.4. Wrote the test to check that number of planes in the airport decreased by 1, made it fail.

 6.5. Wrote some code, the tests pass.

 6.6. Wrote one more test to be sure that the the airport releases a plane, test passed (as expexted, wrote it just to be sure all works)

 6.7. Commited, pushed. Travis is still happy)

7.0 Now to the main point of the third piece of the user story. No landidng if the airport is full. For that I need to introduce var capacity. It is in initialize, so I do not test it. Now, no landidng if the airport is full.

 7.1. Feature test in irb

 ```
 :001 > airport = Airport.new(2)
  => #<Airport:0x007f84019877e0 @planes=[], @capacity=2>
 :002 > 2.times {airport.plane_landing(Plane.new)}
  => 2
 :003 > airport.planes
  => [#<Plane:0x007f8402082cc0 @flying=false>, #<Plane:0x007f8402082c48 @flying=false>]
 :005 > airport.plane_landing(Plane.new)
  => [#<Plane:0x007f8402082cc0 @flying=false>, #<Plane:0x007f8402082c48 @flying=false>, #<Plane:0x007f840196eab0 @flying=false>]
 :006 >
 ```

 Or, after some thinking:

 ```
 :001 > airport = Airport.new
  => #<Airport:0x007ff07a1f7120 @planes=[], @capacity=10>
 :002 > airport.capacity.times {airport.plane_landing(Plane.new)}
 => 10
 :003 > airport.traffic_control
 NoMethodError: undefined method `traffic_control' for #<Airport:0x007ff07a1f7120 @planes=[], @capacity=10>
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/yana/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
 :004 >
 ```

 Trafic control should raise an error if full.
 This one is better.

 7.2. Wrote the test for airport to respond to traffic_control, made it fail, made it pass.

 7.3. Wrote the test for traffic control to raise an error if the airport is full.

 7.4. Wrote some code. The test pass.

 7.5. Commited, pushed.

8.0. Now planes should not be langing if the airport is full. Need to connect traffic_control with landing.

 8.1. Feature test irb

 ```
 :001 > airport = Airport.new
  => #<Airport:0x007fbb6b1afaf8 @planes=[], @capacity=10>
 :002 > airport.capacity.times {airport.plane_landing(Plane.new)}
  => 10
 :004 > airport.traffic_control
 RuntimeError: The airport is full

 :006 >

 ```
 8.2. Wrote the test, made it fail

 8.3. Wrote some code, test pass

 8.4. Commited, pushed

9.0 I think I finished with the piece 3 of the user story.

######Started to work on the last piece of the user story.

1. No landing or take off when the weather is stormy. Now I need to get info about the weather. It seems like a separate class. But I am not sure I can manage it. So after thinking for some time decided to provide weather directly to the airport. Weather should change, so I need separate method for that.

 1.1. Feature test

 ```
 :001 > airport = Airport.new
  => #<Airport:0x007fcd4912e490 @planes=[], @capacity=10, @weather="not stormy">
 :002 > airport.weather_check
 NoMethodError: undefined method `weather_check' for #<Airport:0x007fcd4912e490>
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/yana/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
 :003 >
 ```
 Should return 'stormy' or 'not stormy'

 1.2. Wrote test to check airport responces to weather check, made it fail, then pass.

 1.3. Now the test to check if the weather is stormy. Did not know how to test random, so not sure this one is correct. Wrote test, made it fail.

 1.4 Wrote some code, test passes

 1.5 Commited, pushed

2. Now no landing when the weather is stormy. Will change traffic_control to raise an error.

 2.1 Feature test in irb

 ```
 :001 > airport = Airport.new
 => #<Airport:0x007fe043875c00 @planes=[], @capacity=10, @weather="not stormy">
 :002 > airport.weather_check
 => "stormy"
 :003 > airport.traffic_control
 => nil
 :004 >
 ```

 2.2 Wrote a test, made it fail

 2.3 Wrote some code, the test passed. But had to insert   allow(subject).to receive(:weather_check) { "not stormy" } to all tests.

 2.4 Can not figure out how to do except from before :each. Will do refactoring later.

 2.5 Commited , pushed.

3.0 Now, when I added traffic control to plane_take_off, planes do not take off when the airport is full. Checked it in irb. But they should.

 3.1 Wrote a test, to test that planes take off when the airport is full.

 3.2 Changed code, the test passed. Now error "Airport is full" raised only when plane is landing. So I deleted the test expecting traffic_control to raise this error. I had a test for this error in plane_landing, so do not have anything to add.

 3.3 Refactoring needed! Will try to do it today.
