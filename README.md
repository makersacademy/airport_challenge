Goal of challenge: To use test-driven approach to write an object-orientated code

The Point I got to:
- Feature tests, unit tests and code for planes taking off and landing. Including checking they were removed / added to the @planes Array.

How I would complete the challenge:
- Weather: I would use a random number generator to then assign which method was truthy ie stormy or sunny. (Incomplete weather code within the weather.rb file).
- Capacity to be assigned the number 20 in a method. This method could also be used to produce a fail if the capacity was over 20. A default value for capacity could be set in the initialize method, so planes did not need to be created for the programme to run.
- Fail tests for stormy and capacity put in Rspec file.

How I problem solved:
- Spend potentially too much time reading the challenge and all the material first before starting.
- Started with the feature tests and then code then moved to rspec when I was unsure of Rspec code.
- Used Rspec documents
- Used Rspec tutorials
- Used Stackoverflow
- Used boris bike challenges which I had completed and notes from challenges.
- Used materials given by airport challenge, including testing criteria.


Evaluation of how I preformed the task:

- Spent a lot of time reading the instructions and material provided. Experiment next time with starting sooner and going back to reading material / instructions as needed.
