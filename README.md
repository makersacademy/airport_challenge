This is a challenge given in my week 1 of Makers Academy, forked from there.
In this challenge I will be using different resources learned during the past week plus RSpec. 


You can follow the demands of the challenge in the this link: https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge


I will be using Travis CI to test the proper standars of CI.

Also I used Hound which automatically review the code style.
