Airport Challenge is a program that simulates the air traffic control.

This is done by:
- Initializing planes as being 'airborne'
- Initializing airports with a maximum capacity
- Initializing random weather

The planes are all in the air by default, and thus can be landed by being transferred into an array called 'planes' that is within the airport class.

When a plane is landing, the airport class will have initialized with a default weather setting that is generated by the weather class. This will prevent a landing and throw an error if the weather is 'stormy'.

When a plane is taking off, the airport class will again have initialized with a default weather setting that is generated by the weather class. This will prevent a take off and throw an error if the weather is 'stormy'. If the weather is good the plane will be moved from the planes array and into the airborne array.

The Airports default capacity is set to 10 planes, however this can be changed should the air traffic controller wish to change it.
