* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning


Task
-----

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

```
As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination 
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination 
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy 

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy 

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
```

Notes 
================

For this challenge I managed to create an air traffic control system (to some extent) which had a variable capacity, could create new planes and airports, could take off planes and land them, and referenced a weather generator which determined whether planes would be able to land or not. 

Although this task seemed large at first, once the project was broken down into small chunks, I was able to work through classes and methods one at a time and complete the challenge.
