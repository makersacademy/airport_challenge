## Brief description of what the project is

This project includes software that enables a user to control the flow of planes at an airport.

It includes the following features for air traffic controllers:

1. Enabling planes to land at an airport.
2. Instructing planes to take off from an airport and confirm it is no longer in the airport
3. The ability to track airport capacity. This is set at a default value and can be overridden as appropriate
4. Prevent landing a plane when an airport is full

All in all, this is incredibly useful for air traffic controllers as it can protect against human error (e.g. in tracking airport capacity) and enables air traffic controllers to track multiple airports and planes.

Note: You will notice a file which includes a program that randomises weather. This file exists as the following features which would’ve made use of this functionality and were intended to be implemented could not be completed due to time constraints.

1. Ensuring that takeoff is prevented when the weather is stormy
2. Ensuring landing is prevented when the weather is stormy

With more time, I would have continued with the draft test I have in my spec file (which is commented out).
