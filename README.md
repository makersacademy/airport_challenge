Airport Challenge
=================

```
        ______
        _\____\___
=  = ==(____MA____)
          \_____\___________________,-~~~~~~~`-.._
          /     o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o  |\_
          `~-.__       __..----..__                  )
                `---~~\___________/------------`````
                =  ===(_________)

```

For this challenge I will convert 6 user stories into test-driven code. A plane will be able to land in and take off from an airport, as long as the weather is sunny. 

The Ruby version for this program is ruby-2.5.0.
