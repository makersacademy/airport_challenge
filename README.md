# Airport
A program to control the flow of planes at an airport. Planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.

I completed the user stories and wrote passing tests for them. I tried to implement checking whether planes were airborne or not, but I couldn't get these tests to pass, so I've commented them out.
