Working through the airport-challenge;

I began the challenge by drawing a diagram to make it clear to myself what each
object and method was going to do. Giving each method three boxes to tick upon
completion. These were; feature testing, producing a spec test and finally
producing a code that passed the tests I had made for it.

Before attempting any testing or coding it was important for me to think about
what the methods would be doing in a real life scenario. So for example; for the
land method it was going to be for the airport as air traffic control would be
in charge of ensuring a safe descent for the plane. With this I gave the airport
the method with an argument, that being the plane which would land.

I followed this technique through all the user stories to ensure the software
could complete the desired tasks.
