### Task
    
We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. 

### Process to solve the task              

• Tackled everything one step at a time.

• Transformed the User Story into a Domain Model.

• Made a diagram that shows how Objects will use Messages to communicate with one another.
