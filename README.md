Week 1: Airport Challenge

James Borrell

Design a code simulating an airport, allowing planes to land & take off.

Airport needs to receive and store all landed planes, landed planes cannot

land again. Flying planes can not take off.

The airport should be weather reliant, stormy weather should shut down airport

facilities.

Capacity will vary from airport to airport, will be reflected in the code.

Planes will not be able to land at an airport that is full (at capacity).
