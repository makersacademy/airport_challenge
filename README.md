Airport Challenge
=================

Completed Airport Challenge files

Allows you to create airports and planes, and land and take off planes from airports during fair weather.

Airport uses the take_off and land methods to control planes. Plane instance variables are only changeable from Plane methods so airport calls these as necessary.

Todo would be add a 'specified destination' capability, and therefore airport @name and plane @destination. And ensure specific planes could take off. I did some of this then branched it as I think it was taking the user stories too literally and overcomplicating.
