## Airport Challenge

A simple airport model:
  - Airports store a number of planes (with a maximum capacity)
  - Airports have access to weather information
  - Planes can takeoff/land at Airports
  - Adverse weather/airports being at max capacity can prevent landings/takeoffs

#### Implementation
