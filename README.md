Airport Challenge
=================

Introduction
---------

This project aims to replicate a working airport system, using Ruby. Rspec is used throughout to test all methods.

Features modeled include the following:

* The ability to create (virtually) unlimited airports and planes.
* The ability to land planes at/take-off planes from specified airports.
* A randomized weather system which is usually sunny, but occasionally stormy, during which times planes will be unable to take-off or land.
* The ability to confirm whether a particular plane landed at/taken off from a specified airport.
* A default maximum capacity of 30 planes for each airport, which can be overridden at the time of airport creation.
* Naturally it is impossible to land a plane at/create a plane at an airport which has already reached full capacity.
