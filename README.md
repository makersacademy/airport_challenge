Hi-ho!

NOTES: I had some technical difficulties and limited time on this one and was not able to get rspec working. I bumped into an SSL cert issue when trying to install bundler that ate up much of the time I had available to work. I was able to troubleshoot that and get the gems installed, but rspec continued to error with install attempts. With time constraints I choose to move forward and use the exercise to focus on TDD workflow practices even though I couldn’t test my unit tests.

My strength during this was on feature testing my airport and planes in irb. I liked the idea of using two arrays and a “confirm” method to give the airport controller the ability to have both a global and local look at planes in the air and landed. I also liked easy to decipher info given in my randomized weather forecast, but I have a feeling my return values being “nil” could require a different solution if I were to finish. At any rate I wish I would have gotten this done but it did reinforce quite a bit of boris bike concepts.
