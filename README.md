# Airport Challenge

This Airport challenge allows users to instruct a plane to land and take off from an airport, but only if the weather is sunny! :)

The program also defends against edge cases, so feel free to try and land a plane that is already landed, or instruct a plane at Heathrow to try and depart from Dubai airport.

## Getting started

- First step - Fork this repo and clone it to your local machine
- Second step - Run the command gem install bundler (if you don't have bundler already)
- Third step - When the installation completes, run bundle

Ta-da! You're now qualified to start flying some planes!

## How to use

Now, I know you're excited to get your pilot's hat on, but please read these instructions first, which will walk you through how to test my program. 

- Open your terminal and navigate to the Airport_challenge directory 
- Run irb and require './lib/airport.rb'
- This is where the fun begins!
- You can create plane instances (plane = Plane.new) and airport instances (airport = Airport.new). I'd recommend getting creative - maybe try and fly your own private jet to Paris for the night (a girl can dream!).
- To instruct a plane to take off from an airport you can use the 'take_off' method (airport.take_off(plane))
- To instruct a plane to land you can use the 'land' method (airport.land(plane))
## Some things to note
- The airport's default capacity is set to 20 planes, so if you would like to change the airports default capacity, you can pass your desired capacity as an integer to the airport instance eg (airport = Airport.new(200))
- You will only be able to land and take-off planes if the weather is sunny. Luckily, the weather is sunny 80% of the time, and stormy the other 20%. 

## Running tests

- If you would like to run my unit tests, run rspec in the Airport_challenge directory.
