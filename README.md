#Airport Challenge
My approach:
- start with the tests and avoid spiking
- deploy simplicity and use the SRP wherever possible
- work through the user stories that I know how to implement quickly, spending longer on areas I am unsure of
- focus on learning, rather than completing

##Where I got to
I didn't finish the challenge but implemented all user stories, excepting those to do with the weather. I am also still working on the edge cases.

##How I would finish
I would create a new class for 'Weather', using it in the Airport class where needed - mainly through raising error messages with if statements - to prevent landing and take off if stormy.
I need to do more research into randomising, and then overriding, the weather output.
