This is a program to help manage and control the flow of planes at an airport.

There are 2 classes, Airport and Plane. An instance of the airport class is able to accept a number of planes landing and let planes take off if the weather is sunny. In stormy conditions planes are prevented from landing and take off.

Airports have a default capacity of 20 planes, however capacity can be overridden.

Weather is generated randomly, and is mostly sunny, but can be stormy 20% of the time.
