Instructions
---------

* Had to create a working airport that accepted landing planes and allows planes to take off.
* If the weather was bad, planes not allowed to do their jobs.
* It annoyed me.

Issues Encountered
----------

* I completed the user stories. Possibly haven't touched all the edge cases but I did attempt to.
* Realised at the end that my Plane class and plane_spec are close to useless.
* I kept all my trial and errors in comments to look over later.
* After I implemented the random weather, couldn't get any feature tests to work anymore as the results were random each time and I was unable to set the weather to be specific.
* airport_spec.rb lacks DRYness, lots of repetition to keep the weather in certain ways for conditions to be fulfilled. Was unsure as to how to go around this.
* Hopefully will be able to fix all issues in the coming week depending on what I learn.
