Makers Academy Week1 Challenge: Airport Challenge.
==================================================

How I went about the challenge:
-------------------------------
First I wrote in comments what I wanted to do at a particular step.
Then I wrote in english what I thought the test should do.
I changed the english to be more rspecy before finally writing it fully in rspec.
Then I checked to see if the test failed.
Finally I wrote the code to pass the test.
