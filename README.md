Airport Challenge
=================

What is it?
---------

Airport challenge is an airport simulation program made in ruby using OOP and
BDD/TDD methodologies. The User story was the following:
```
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport and confirm that it has landed

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
```


Design Process
-------

I followed the BDD life cycle.
* First I isolated the different user stories, eg.:
  **So I can get passengers to a destination
  I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport and confirm that it has landed**
* I created the acceptance tests (or feature tests):
  **Airport, planes, weather**
* Then multiple unit tests for every acceptance test eg.:
  **Airport: inbound_planes, outbound_planes**
* And last the implementation:
  **class Airport end, class Plane end**


Build Process
-----

I tried using SOLID and encapsulation principles for this challenge to get into
the habit of proper programming.
A SOLID resource: https://subvisual.co/blog/posts/19-solid-principles-in-ruby

I made this challenge the TDD way, by writing the Rspec Unit test before my
actual code. I created the Unit tests the London way as DRY as i could, and the
final overall feature test using the Chicago way.

I made the weather functionality as a module with a Constant array which I
froze, hound dog suggested the .freeze method (doesn't allow further changes).
And i decided to make it a Module because it's a constant and can be reused in
many classes(or programs) if i wanted to.
