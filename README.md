# Airport Challenge

My approach was to use as much learnings from the boris bike challenge as possible.

I also used TDD and largely only wrote code which I could test.

I started late and was unable to work out how to only let instances of Planes land/takeoff. This was because I didn't know how to reference the Plane code in the airport.rb file.
