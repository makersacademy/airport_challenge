I used TDD to build tests that fulfilled the requirements set out in the user stories given. Using the user stories I could see that two main classes were required, 'airport' and 'plane' and I built unit tests for these classes that met the requirements given by the user stories. Once I had written all the tests, I set out actually building the classes, soon realising that a Weather class would be beneficial in generating a random weather forecast, to follow the Single Responsobility Principle. I therefore added a unit test for this class and then built it.
