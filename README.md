#README#

This is my first attempt at the airport challenge set by Makers Academy.

The aim of this program is to create a system for an airport that allows them to instruct planes to take off and land, and to prevent planes doing either if the weather is stormy or the airport is full. This program can be applied to any given airport's capacity.

#PROCESS THAT I FOLLOWED#

1. Read user stories and identify objects and messages.
2. Create a diagram of the domain model.
3. Write first feature test
4. Write first rspec test
5. Fix code for test to pass
6. Repeat steps 3-5

I followed this method up until a certain point, and then hit a block, not understanding how to proceed next from the test errors. Eventually, I was directed to look at the following solution - https://github.com/dearshrewdwit/airport_challenge/blob/example_6/spec/airport_spec.rb

I had a quick scan through and decided to go back to one of my early commits and start again.

I followed the TDD method again after this. However, this was quite late on the Sunday so I was unable to make much progress. Monday morning, I worked through some errors from the spec failures and then finished.

#REFLECTION#

I started well, and was pleased with my progress understanding the TDD method, including identifying the objects and messages. The biggest error I made was to focus too much on the 'plane' object rather than the 'airport' object. This led me down the wrong path with the TDD process.

I also feel that I overcomplicated things, rather than reflecting on what I had learnt from Boris Bikes this week and using that knowledge to guide me.

On reflection, I feel that I need to increase my understanding on objects and classes. Specifically, how to identify which should be the 'main' object, and how classes interact with each other.
