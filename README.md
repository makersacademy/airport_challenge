## Overview

This is a simple program that controls the flow of planes at an airport. Planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny, which is most of the time. Occasionally, when it storms, no planes can land or take off. Additionally, the airport has a set capacity (which may change from time to time) and planes will be turned away if that capacity is reached. 

Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

```
As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination 
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport and confirm that it has landed 

As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination 
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy 

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy 

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
```
