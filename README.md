  Status

  Completed

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

Generated random weather pattern and used this to prevent an plane from landing if it is stormy

  Attempted
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport and confirm that it has landed

I didn't manage to test to see ensure that only planes can take off from airports they are in.  Or that planes that are already flying cannot take off and/or be in airport. Or that planes that are landed cannot land again and must be in aiport

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

Ran our of time

As an air traffic controller
