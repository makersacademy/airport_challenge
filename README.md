# Makers Academy Week 1 Weekend Challenge (Airport Challenge)

## Description

This is my first ever independently-completed TDD project. The implementation is in Ruby with all tests using Rspec. It consists of 2 classes (airports and planes) and they interract with each other in the ways you would expect a basic model of an airport and planes to interract. The user stories that were used to build this project are:

```
As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination 
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination 
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy 

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy 
```

* There is no way to 'use' this project, as it is just classes and methods and their respective tests, but if you want to interract with it, feel free!

It is a basic application that is functionally useless but is intended to help me learn/practise some basic concepts:

1. How to test-drive the building of something from start to finish (all my previous coding practice had literally no tests), including learning Rspec and Ruby syntax
2. How to best decide between how many/what properties of each class I should have and then the methods to appropriately model the behaviour of the airport and planes

# Requirements
- Ruby 3.0.0
- Rspec for running the tests

Feel free to fork/clone this repo, though I wouldn't recommend it as it is incredibly basic, and I am just including this here as good practice for writing a good README,really.
