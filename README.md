### Notes
I diligently stuck to writing the tests before the code on this challenge.
It helped going step by step and laying out what I wanted the code to accomplish, fixing the red and getting to green. The tree A's stuck with me throughout the test creation. Arrange the code, make the code Act to set up the values, then Assert, writing what I expect to come back.

I found it strange writing what I expected to come back in the tests and then creating the program to pass those tests. I can immediately see the many advantages of developing this way, the code felt more robust in some ways and less eager to break. Though I did break the tests themsleves an awful lot, though I think that's more due to not being very familiar with the testing syntax and the other various things it can do like doubles, mocking and stubs. As of right now developing this way seems very slow, but I think that is because I'm not used to it yet.

I got stuck on trying to create a random weather method to dictate whether landing was possible or not. I was trying to get the tests to return a predetermined value each time, regardless if it returned elephants, I wanted it to return bananas. I just couldn't get it to do it and after looking at the time I realised I spent another 2 hours on this one problem messing around with things. I returned it all to a manual method for now. I may come back to it to fix it once I know how to get it to do what I want it to. For now though I'm happy that I'm seeing some progress. On monday I knew nothing about TDD, now I know enough to write my own tests.. even if they aren't that advanced yet.
