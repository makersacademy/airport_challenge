<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>Makers Academy, Week 1 Solo Project</h2>

This is a solo project completed at the end of week 1 of the <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a> full stack developer course.

<h2>Project aim</h2>
To replicate a rudimentary working airport system using Ruby.

<h2>Project tech stack</h2>

* Ruby
* Test Driven Development ("TDD") techniques, including features tests in IRB and unit tests via Rspec
* Object oriented programming
* Classes
* Best practices, including but not limited to: single responsibility principle, encapsulation and private methods

<h1>Project features</h1>

* Creation of unlimited virtual plans and airports
* Organising plan take-offs and landings to and from specified airports.
* Ability to confirm whether a plane landed/took-off from a specified airport.
* A randomized weather system which is usually sunny, but occasionally stormy, during which times planes will be grounded (i.e. unable to take-off or land).
* A default maximum capacity of 30 planes for newly created airports, which can be overridden at the time of airport creation depending on airport capacity requirements.
* A restriction on landing/creating a plane at an airport already at maximum capacity.
