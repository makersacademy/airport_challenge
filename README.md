# Airport challenge

Work done for the week 1 challenge for [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com)

I broke the challenge down into its User Stories and tried to tackle them one at a time. I left the weather User Stories until the end.

I used TDD best practices, feature test, unit test, code.
