Airport Challenge
=================

**This software will control the flow of planes at an airport.**

The planes are authorized to land and take off when the weather is sunny. If it is stormy, no planes can land or take off from the airport. (weather will be generated randomly)

The program will be developed in a test driven manner, writing feature and unit tests for every object that will be created.
