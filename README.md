**Makers Academy Week 1 Solo Challenge**

- This simple script, developed with TDD, simulates how Airports control the flow of planes.
- Each plane can land and take off, provided it has received authorization by the airport.
- Planes are denied permission to land or take off in adverse weather conditions. In addition, planes are denied permission to land in airports that are at full capacity.
- The weather conditions are generated automatically every time authorization for landing and taking off is prompted.

**Technologies Used**
- Ruby
- Rspec
