Airport Challenge
=================

Overview
-------

This is a weekend coding challenge after the first week of a 12 week intensive coding bootcamp at Makers Academy. It is a simulation of code to run airports and planes in an air traffic control system. 

Specification
---------
This software has been written from the point of view of the plane and runs in the Command Line. It is based around the following user stories:

> As an air traffic controller <br>
> So I can get passengers to a destination <br>
> **I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport**

> As an air traffic controller <br>
> So I can get passengers on the way to their destination <br>
**I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport**

>As an air traffic controller <br>
To ensure safety <br>
**I want to prevent landing when the airport is full**

>As the system designer<br>
So that the software can be used for many different airports<br>
**I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate**

>As an air traffic controller <br>
To ensure safety <br>
**I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy**

>As an air traffic controller <br>
To ensure safety <br>
**I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy**

Instuctions
----
To run the software ensure you are in the same directory as the file plane.rb and access it using irb. 

You will need to require two files to run this software

```
require './plane.rb'
require './airport.rb'
```

To create a new airport with default capacity of 20 planes.
```
airport_name = Airport.new
```
To change the capacity of an airport
```
airport_name.capacity = new_capacity
```
To create a new plane
```
plane_name = plane.new
```
To land a plane
```
plane_name.land(airport_name)
```
To take_off
```
plane.take_off(airport_name)
```

Coding Process
-------

I started this challenge by having a think about how I am going to set myself up and how I am going to approach it. I forked the repo, and I set myself up with this README to keep track of my process and the documentation as I go. 

For the first couple of user stories I followed a simple process of reading the story, extracting a simple user expectation, testing it it irb - watch it fail, write a test in rspec, watch it fail, fix the tests until I have a passing test. 

Story 3, together with the edge cases felt a little different. I made a cup of tea and had a break. I felt that this one might need to be broken down into more parts, so I started with some notes and diagramming and then worked from these. 

From this I wrote some new user stories for each of the scenarios it brought up for me - I will test these, and I think consequently I will have fixed the others at the end.

I then realised that design decisions I had made - to hold plane data within airports, not on the planes, might give me issues later in the software. Reflecting on it I came to the conclusion that this was serious enough to start again - so I deleted everything and started again with a new design strategy, following similar steps to above. 

To test the weather cases I created a double that tells the airport that the weather is stormy. 

As I went, if I felt that new test made a previous one redundent, then I removed it. 

At the end I spent some time refactoring the code, and then tidying up this document. 

Lastly I wrote a feature_spec.rb file. 

Reflections
----
I'm not clear whether my original design strategy (to control landing and take off of planes from the point of view of an airport) or my new one (to control it all from the point of the plane) is better. What I do know however, is that allowing a design emerge in this way feels sub-optimal, and I think that time spent diagramming and psuedo coding could lead to more clarity about the overal picture, what the implications of earlier decisions are / could be and allow me to start writing code with more clarity.
