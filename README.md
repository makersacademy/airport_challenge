#Approach and startegy to the task:
When starting this exercise the first thing I've done was read the script several times and create a diagram that helps me break down all of the problems into small steps:

**Airport 

- responds to land - and takes in planes
- responds to take off - let's planes leave
- prevents take off when it it stormy
- prevents land when it is stormy
- can be ither full or empty and has a default capacity

**Planes

- can take off
- can land

**Weahter 

- is a constant and is randomly selected but needs to be stormy sometimes 

#This helped me create classes in my head and I then started creating tests to start making methods
