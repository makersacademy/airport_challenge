Airport Challenge

```
        ______
        _\____\___

          \_____\___________________,-~~~~~~~`-.._
          /     o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o  |\_
          `~-.__       __..----..__                  )
                `---~~\___________/------------`````
                =  ===(_________)

```

For this challenge my approach to solving it was TDD. If I got stuck on something
I first tried to figure it out on my own, next I turned to google, loving
stack-overflow. If I still couldn't solve it, then I turned to the review code
section.
