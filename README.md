Airport Challenge
=================

My approach
---------

* I read the user stories and broke them down into things I need the programme to do
* For each line of "I want to be able to do this", I wrote the simplest test, fixed it, and repeated

Reflection
-------

1. I didn't feature test anything in ```irb``` as I went. Would this have changed my design/approach at all?
2. I have written what I think is the cleanest, simplest code for the task that I have ever written. My concern - have I actually answered all of the brief?
3. My head just doesn't want to think up new edge cases!

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
