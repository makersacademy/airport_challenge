This program is designed to replicate an airport system and instruct a set of planes to land and take off under a set of certain requirements. 
Currently my program is able to do the following:
- Instruct a plane to land
- Instruct a plane to take off and confirm it isn't at the airport
- Prevent a plane from landing if the airport is full
- Has a default airport capacity that can be overriden

To develop my code I would like to change the airport system's ability instruct planes to land and take off by making this dependent on the weather conditions. To do this I plan to create a new weather class that can randomise the weather and prevent take off and landing when the weather is stormy.
