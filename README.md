General Strategy
---------

* My general strategy was to follow the boris bike structure.
* I planned to keep the classes as empty as possible and use doubles for all the tests

Problems
-------

1. My main problem which prevented me from completing the challenge was to work out a way of setting the double to a specific value in order to keep the random nature of the weather stable.
2. I intended to use similar syntax to the Boris Bike challenge, setting the stormy? attribute to true or false. However many hundreds of ways I tried variations on this it was still bringing up errors elsewhere.

How I would complete the task
-----

1. I would set the default capacity of the airport as an initialize parameter.
