## Airport Challenge
---

My submission for this challenge includes two classes, ``Plane`` and ``Airport``, and a module, ``Weather``

### ``Plane``

- is initialized with a single argument with a default value of **false**, which is assigned to the variable ``in_flight``

- has three public methods:

  - ``takeoff`` and ``land``, which set ``in_flight`` to **true** or **false** respectively and â”€

  - ``in_flight?`` which returns its value

### ``Airport``

- is initialized with three arguments:

  - ``capacity`` indicating the maximum number of planes permitted to land at the airport, with a default of 1

  - ``weather`` indicating the current weather at the airport, whose default is generated by ``Weather.random`` as being either ``:clear`` or ``:stormy``

  - ``planes`` indicating all the planes which are currently at the airport, with an empty array ``[]`` as its default value

- has two private methods:

  - `full?` which is **true** when the size of ``planes`` has reached the airport `capacity`

  - `safe?` which is **true** if the ``weather`` at the airport is ``:clear``, **false** in any other case

- has two explicitly defined public methods:

  - ``clear_for_landing`` takes a ``Plane`` object as an argument and:

    - checks that the plane is ``in_flight?``,
      landing is ``safe?`` and the airport is 
      **not** ``full?``
    
    - if these conditions are met, allows the plane to ``land`` and adds it to the list of ``planes`` 
  
  - ``clear_for_takeoff`` takes a ``Plane`` object as an argument and:

    - checks that the plane is **not** already ``in_flight?``, is present at the airport in the list of ``planes`` and that takeoff is ``safe?``

    - if these conditions are met, allows the plane to ``takeoff`` and removes it from the list of ``planes``

- has two methods, `capacity` and `capacity=` which are defined via `attr_accessor` to allow viewing and changing the capacity after an airport is initialized

### ``Weather``

- has two objects:

  - ``@@states``, an array containing the symbols `:clear` and `:stormy` in amounts reflecting the frequency of their occurance

  - ``self.random`` which calls `@@states.sample` to produce a weighted sample of either `:clear` or `:stormy` and returns the result

## How I met the specifications

- Allowed planes to take off and land at an airport
- Prevented landing at full airports
- Prevented takeoff and landing in bad weather
- Allowed overriding default airport capacity
- Dealt with edge cases:
  - preventing takeoff of a plane that is not in airport
  - preventing landing of a plane that is not in the air
  - only allowing planes to land
- Completed the challenge using TDD
- Achieved 100% test coverage
- Kept each class, module and test suite in a seperate file
- Kept methods short and with a single-responsibility
- Used rubocop to ensure an acceptable style
