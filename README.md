# Airport Challenge

The first individual, weekend challenge set by Makers Academy during their intensive, well-respected 12-week course in Ruby and web development.

This challenge is based on industry tech-tests and is evaluated with the same metrics.

## Approach
I used the user stories to identity objects and desired messages before implementing a domain model to graphically map these relationships and create a road map for meeting the requirements.

### How much did I complete?

I have managed to implement:
  - Planes that take instruction to land and take off, w hen passed the specific airport to do so from.

  - Planes that confirm whether they have landed or taken off and can be requested to confirm this at other times.

  - Airports that accept specific aircraft when requested, unless they are at capacity.

  - Airports that release specific aircraft when requested, unless of course that aircraft doesn't exist or the airport has no aircraft.

  - Randomly generated weather

### Coverage and Style
  - 100% Coverage
  - Rubocop completed almost every commit (no style offenses)
