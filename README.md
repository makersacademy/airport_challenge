Approach to Solution
---------

**Landing a plane at an airport**

- The first step I took was to write tests for creating classes for the airport and plane in the user story.

- I then wrote the tests to check that an airport instance could respond to the land method with one argument, then wrote the code.

- To store the plane it would need to go into an empty array, so I initialized an empty array and made the land method push the plane argument to the array.

**Taking off from the airport**

- No new classes needed to be made, so I wrote the tests for having a plane land at the airport and subsequently leave.

- Writing the code for this was relatively straightforward, just removing the plane from the hangar and returning a confirmation.

**Edge cases**

- To stop a plane landing twice, I wrote the test and code that would raise an error if the plane already existed in the hangar and tried to land.

- Similarly, a plane could still take off twice. The tests and code for this were very similar; just checking the hangar contained the plane and, if not, raising an error.

**Stormy weather**

- To simulate the weather I created a new class that would initialize with a number between 0 and 5.

- I created a private method within the airport class that would return true if weather initialized with 5.

- Within the land and takeoff method I raised an error if the private method (stormy?) was true.

- I used stubs in the tests to mimic the return value of stormy?

**Capacity**

- To set a default capacity of the hangar I made a constant called DEFAULT_CAPACITY. Upon initializing a new instance of the airport, it will default to the constant unless the user includes a custom amount.

- To safeguard against too many planes being in the hangar, I created a private method 'full?' which is used by the land and take-off methods. An error will be raised if capacity+1 planes are placed in the hangar.

Instructions
---------

* Challenge time: rest of the day and weekend, until Monday 9am

* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Steps
-------

1. Fork this repo, and clone to your local machine
2. Run the command `gem install bundle` (if you don't have bundle already)
3. When the installation completes, run `bundle`

Task
-----

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

```
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
```

Your task is to test drive the creation of a set of classes/modules to satisfy all the above user stories. You will need to use a random number generator to set the weather (it is normally sunny but on rare occasions it may be stormy). In your tests, you'll need to use a stub to override random weather to ensure consistent test behaviour.

Your code should defend against [edge cases](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/125587/what-are-the-difference-between-an-edge-case-a-corner-case-a-base-case-and-a-b) such as inconsistent states of the system ensuring that planes can only take off from airports they are in; planes that are already flying cannot takes off and/or be in an airport; planes that are landed cannot land again and must be in an airport, etc.

For overriding random weather behaviour, please read the documentation to learn how to use test doubles: https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/docs . There’s an example of using a test double to test a die that’s relevant to testing random weather in the test.

Please create separate files for every class, module and test suite.

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance will make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.

**BONUS**

* Write an RSpec **feature** test that lands and takes off a number of planes

Note that is a practice 'tech test' of the kinds that employers use to screen developer applicants.  More detailed submission requirements/guidelines are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Finally, don’t overcomplicate things. This task isn’t as hard as it may seem at first.

* **Submit a pull request early.**  There are various checks that happen automatically when you send a pull request.  **Fix these issues if you can**.  Green is good.

* Finally, please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am.
