## Airport Challenge
-----------------------
This was my weekend challenge for Week 1 of Makers Academy. In order to complete the task I had to create an air traffic control system; whereby a plane would take off and land at an airport. Sometimes the airport would be full, preventing landing, whilst the weather could also be stormy, preventing take off and landing. The learning objectives included consolidation knowledge on TDD and rspec syntax. 

### Classes

My classes were:

#### Challenges
---------------
I was unable to complete the 3rd User Story: 

*As the system designer*
*So that the software can be used for many different airports*
*I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate*

Having been stuck on it making the code work for too long today, I have identified this as a weakness in my abilities and will be targeting this over the week next week.
