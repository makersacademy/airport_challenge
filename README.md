# Airport challenge

Airport challenge is a program that controls the flow of planes at an airport.The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it's stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. It covers against edge cases such as landing planes which have already landed and uses RSPEC as the testing framework â€“ incorporating mocks and doubles where appropriate. It attains 98% test coverage.
