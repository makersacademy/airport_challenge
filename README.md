Airport Challenge
==================

This is my first challenge. The aim of the project is to implement 6 user stories (see in doc directory) in order to control the flow of planes in/out in different airports. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.
