Programme that allows the user to be an air traffic controller!

The user can create airports and planes. These planes cann take off and land from airports. Planes will be prevented from taking off and landing if the airport capacity is full, or if the weather is stormy.

QUESTIONS:
- running rspec repeatedly sometimes passes and sometimes fails - possible problem with my use 'allow' syntax?
- I couldn't work out how to test that a specific plane has taken off from the airport (and therefore has left the planes array) - I'm not sure that my test covers this
- my raise_error tests were leading to my take_off test to fail (specifically the 'confirms that the plane is no longer in the airport' test) and I'm not sure why
