Intro
---------
A request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. 

Objects
-------

Airport
- Allows specific planes to land and take-off, if the capacity holds
- Possibility to set capacity
- Only lets planes land and take-off if the weather isn't stormy

Plane
- Stores the info whether it's stationed or flying
