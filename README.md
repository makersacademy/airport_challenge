Weekend challenge to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off, by creating a set of classes and modules. 

Random number generator will be used to to set the weather. A stud will be needed to override to ensure consistent test behaviour. 

That is a practice 'Tech Test' for developer applicants.  More detailed submission requirements/guidelines are in (CONTRIBUTING.md)
