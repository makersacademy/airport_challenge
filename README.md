Task
-----

To write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories that I have followed:

```
As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination 
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination 
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy 

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy 
```



Written code defends against such edge cases as:
 - inconsistent states of the system ensuring that planes can only take off from airports they are in; 
 - planes that are already flying cannot take off and/or be in an airport; 
 - planes that are landed cannot land again and must be in an airport.



It was ennsured that:

* All tests passing
* Test coverage is 100%
* The code is elegant: passes all the ```rubocop``` quality tests 
* Code includes an RSpec **feature** test that lands and takes off a number of planes
