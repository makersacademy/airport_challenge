#Welcome to air traffic control!
```
This ap will:

 #.Create an airport with either default capacity or
    the ability to change it yourself
 #.Won't let planes land or take off in Stormy weather
 #.Won't let a plane land if it is in the airport
 #.Won't let a plane take off that isn't in the airport
 #.You can check the status of the plane (wether its flying or not)
 #.You can also check which planes are inside the airport


[*********************************************************************]
        Create a default airport and plane in IRB like so:

2.2.3 :001 > require './lib/airport'
 => true
2.2.3 :002 > plane = Plane.new
 => #<Plane:0x007faf32019710 @passengers=241, @status=:Flying>
2.2.3 :003 > airport = Airport.new
 => #<Airport:0x007faf318b4ce0 @the_weather=:Cloudy, @runway=[], @capacity=5> #

[*********************************************************************]
        Create an airport with your own capacity in IRB like so:

2.2.3 :001 > require './lib/airport'
 => true
2.2.3 :002 > airport = Airport.new(24)
 => #<Airport:0x007fe1638bcb70 @the_weather=:Cloudy, @runway=[], @capacity=24>
2.2.3 :003 > plane = Plane.new
 => #<Plane:0x007fe163040f28 @passengers=176, @status=:Flying>

[*********************************************************************]
                    Basic commands:

<airport>.land_plane(<plane>) - Lands the selected plane
<airport>.take_off(<plane>) - Selected Plane leaves the airport
<airport>.runway - gives list of planes on runway
<airport>.change_weather - this allows you to alter the weather if its stormy..
<plane>.status - Plane's current status
