Airport Challenge
=================

This is my first solo project for the first weekend Challenge on Makers Academy.

This project is about a system to control the flow of planes, landing and take off,
always based on weather conditions.

I was requested to apply all technologies learned until now, TDD, BDD, SRP, RsPec,
Ruby and some other tools.

One assumption from my side was the fact that every `plane` instances I create is `in air`.

I could concluded this challenge without viewing any solution posted on the web, it should be more elegant ways to solve it, but this was my own approach. 

Thanks to Makers Academy for all its support on this learning process
