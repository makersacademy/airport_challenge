Airport Challenge
=================

Thinking
---------

I really struggled with how to set up the feature tests. I started over three times.
I eventually decided that the top level features had to be very simple for me
and have deviated far from the original prompts.

I would really like to talk through my attempts at feature tests with someone.

I keep coming up against a wall when deciding where the method call is going.
If I want the airport to approve a plane for landing, how can I structure
those four elements? Where should the methods be called?

Finally, I cannot make my airport capacity test validate. I get an ArgumentError.

All in all, I'm disappointed in myself that I couldn't do a better job on this challenge, 
but I look forward to coming back to it and making it work after feedback.
