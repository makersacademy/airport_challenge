My process:
---------
First I read through the user stories, which led me to decide that the first two classes I wanted to make were Airport and Plane. I made a file for each of these classes and then made each a corresponding spec file. I then made tests for the basic methods of the Plane and Airport classes which I then implemented. At the point where I was implementing storms I decided this functionality should really have it's own class so I made a new class called Weather and a spec file for its tests.
