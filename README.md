# Airport Challenge

I approached this problem by first reading the user stories and determining which objects would need to be created by looking at the nouns in the user stories.

I then began with the plane class as i thought that the methods should apply to that. I wrote tests and made them pass and from this i was able to determine what behaviour was required from the airport.Once I knew the desired behaviour of the airport I began writing tests for its class and making them pass.

After completing this I came to the conclusion that the methods I had created for the plane may have been bertter applied to the airport but unfortunately I did not have the time to rewrite the classes and their tests again.
