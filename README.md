###Airport Challenge###

The purpose of the Airport Challenge is to test the knowledge of and skills in BDD, TDD and OOP gained over the previous few weeks. The ideas is to build a working airport with aeroplanes based on the use-cases outlined in the [Instructions](./Instructions.md) over the weekend, and then submit the progress by 09:00 on Monday 23rd March.

I have really struggled with this challenge this weekend. I still cannot figure out how to translate the user stories into feature tests. I am also confused as to how feature tests and unit tests differ: in all examples I have read (including the Boris Bikes exercises) it seems the feature tests and unit tests test for exactly the same behaviour. I even struggled to translate the examples in the Boris Bikes exercises into something that I could use in the Airport Challenge.

In addition, I have really struggled to find the correct usage for applying stubs to method returns to consistently mask out the required behaviour from a given method. Many examples give the required syntax, but none explain what each item refers to.

It may not seem like I have much work to show here, especially given the commit history, but rest assured that I devoted far too much time researching and asking questions, for most of which the results were not appropriate to add to any commit.

I can only apologise for the current state of this project, but it is the best I have been able to do for the momentâ€¦
