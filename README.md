Task
-----

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

```
As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination 
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination 
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy 

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy 
```

Approach Method
---------------

My approach to solving the problem was to build an airport class and a plane class. The main methods required (land_plane and take_off_plane) made more sense being defined in the airport class. I then used three instance variables which were hangar, capacity and weather. To me, it makes sense for each airport to have its own randomly generated weather as an instance variable, than to have a separate weather class. I then used the instance_variable_set method to override the random weather in the tests. Overall, my approach was to read each user story and then build tests for all possible outcomes of the user story. I then used the error messages from each test to make writing the methods easier.
