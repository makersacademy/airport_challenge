Task
-----

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

```
As an air traffic controller
So planes can land safely at my airport
I would like to instruct a plane to land

As an air traffic controller
So planes can take off safely from my airport
I would like to instruct a plane to take off

As an air traffic controller
So that I can avoid collisions
I want to prevent airplanes landing when my airport if full

As an air traffic controller
So that I can avoid accidents
I want to prevent airplanes landing or taking off when the weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
So that I can ensure safe take off procedures
I want planes only to take off from the airport they are at

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

As an air traffic controller
So the system is consistent and correctly reports plane status and location
I want to ensure a flying plane cannot take off and cannot be in an airport

As an air traffic controller
So the system is consistent and correctly reports plane status and location
I want to ensure a plane that is not flying cannot land and must be in an airport

As an air traffic controller
So the system is consistent and correctly reports plane status and location
I want to ensure a plane that has taken off from an airport is no longer in that airport
```

Your task is to test drive the creation of a set of classes/modules to satisfy all the above user stories. You will need to use a random number generator to set the weather (it is normally sunny but on rare occasions it may be stormy). In your tests, you'll need to use a stub to override random weather to ensure consistent test behaviour.

Please create separate files for every class, module and test suite.

The submission will be judged on the following criteria:

* Tests pass
* [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) is good
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

**BONUS**

* Write an RSpec **feature** test that lands and takes off a number of planes

Finally, don’t overcomplicate things. This task isn’t as hard as it may seem at first.


My Approach
------------

Throughout this task I made sure that I consistently stuck to the routine of **Red-Green-Refactor**.
Below is a step-by-step list which shows how I attempted each user story:

1. Distinguish nouns (objects) and verbs (messages/methods) from user story.
2. Create Domain Model to illustrate how the objects and messages would interact.
3. Do a Feature Test (usally in irb) and make it fail (**red**).
4. Create a Unit Test (in RSpec) and make it fail (**red**).
5. Implement code to lib/ files to make unit test pass (**green**).
6. Make feature test pass (**green**).
7. **Refactor** code.
8. Move to next user story and repeat above steps.

For this task my aim was to have a very simple approach as the user stories were simple in their own way.
As a result, I had created two classes:

* [Airport](https://github.com/hsheikhm/airport_challenge/blob/master/lib/airport.rb)
* [Plane](https://github.com/hsheikhm/airport_challenge/blob/master/lib/plane.rb)

Starting with the **Airport** class, I built it so that it would be *initialized* with an empty planes array and a
default capacity (which can be overridden). It has two main methods, *'land'* and *'take_off'* to control the landing and taking-off of planes. It also has two predicate methods, *'full?'* and *'stormy?'* to monitor airport capacity and check
for stormy weather. Stormy weather results in no planes being landed or taken-off.

As for the **Plane** class, I kept it as simple as possible. It has been built with the mindset that the user
can always check the *'status'* and *'location'* of a plane at anytime. The status and location of a plane
changes depending on whether it is *'flying'* or has *'landed'*. I decided that it would be best to *initialize* a plane
with a status of 'flying' and location of 'air' since this would prevent an airport from landing a plane that
is simply not flying i.e. a plane that has landed already.

Lastly, my [spec](https://github.com/hsheikhm/airport_challenge/tree/master/spec) files have been separated into two,
one for Airport and the other for Plane. Whilst using the **RSpec** framework I made sure to keep both tests isolated
by the use of **doubles** and **method stubs**. This way I could achieve consistent test behaviour.

Below is my directory tree structure:
```
lib/
    - airport.rb
    - plane.rb
spec/
    - airport_spec.rb
    - plane_spec.rb
    - spec_helper.rb
```

    RuntimeError: Landing denied. Weather is stormy!
<!-- Plane cannot take-off if weather is stormy: -->

    RuntimeError: Take-off denied. Weather is stormy!
<!-- Airport can have a specific capacity: -->
  2.2.3 :053 > airport = Airport.new(50)
    => #<Airport:0x007f9604181630 @planes=[], @capacity=50>
<!-- Plane cannot land if it has already landed: -->

    => #<Plane:0x007fdeaa1e5ad8 @status=:landed, @location=:airport>
  2.2.3 :005 > airport.land(plane)
    => "Plane has already landed"
<!-- A plane taken-off from an airport is no longer in that airport: -->
