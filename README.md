## Bananas International Airport

Welcome to Bananas International Airport, where it's sunny 80% of the time.

Our airport can only take 10 planes and you're welcome to land here if there's space and you're crazy enough. Just make sure that you build your plane up in the air - this is Bananas after all!

#### What can I do in here?

Bananas is a land of one banana brain only and its airport is far from perfect. This is what you can do at the moment:

* Land your plane, as long as there's space and the weather allows it.

* Take-off, as long as there's no storm coming.

#### What can I expect from Bananas International Airport in the future?

* A message telling you that you can or can't land
