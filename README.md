## Prepare for takeoff... 

The "Aiport Challenge" was the first weekend challenge at Makers Academy. Here, priniciples of OOD and TDD (Ruby/RSpec) have been practiced and applied.
Planes have the ability to land, be stored in a hanger and takeoff again. Planes may not land if the hanger is full. 
The weather alternates between "sunny" and "stormy" - Planes cannot take off if the weather is stormy. 
All code has 100% test coverage.
