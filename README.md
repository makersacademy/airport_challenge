#Weekend_Challenge1_Airport Challenge
 ##My approach:
 -Tested each objective before committing and moving on
 -Tried to use the SRP model when I could
 -Did the user stories in the order of which I knew how to do them first. This allowed me to build out my program, however, made me spend more time looking into the areas I did not know work. I made sure wrote out my programs (even on paper!) to ensure I understood what I was doing and why I was doing it.

 ##Where I got to
 -I allowed for a plane to take off, land, set a capacity and implemented the weather. -However, my weather report is left unfinished. I am also working on the remaining edge cases that are left out at the moment.

 ##How I would finish
  -Finish working on my weather lib and spec, testing it out, and introduce edge cases.
  -I would also try to keep testing my program throughout to ensure the airport and plane responds to the stormy weather appropriately by raising an error.
  -Better understand doubles and randomising
