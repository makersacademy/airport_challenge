Airport Project

Plane Class:
  - Contains the functionality of a plane, allowing it to take off and land at certain airports as well as check if it is flying or not. 
  - Flying planes can not take-off and grounded planes can not land.

Airport Class:
 - Starts off with no planes and a capacity based on the airports size. 
 - Landing planes adds the plane to the airport and taking-off removes it. 
 - The weather is checked before a plane can land or take off, to ensure it is safe to do so. 
 - Planes are not able to land if the airport has reached it's maximum capacity.
