Unfortunately I was not able to sleep except for a few hours the entire weekend so I haven't managed to complete this.  I am happy with where I got to and the approach I used though, despite having a really foggy mind while writing it.

I first mapped out a domain model after reading the user stories, then listed the basic variables and methods the classes would need.  Developed tests for those and then went on to interaction between classes.
