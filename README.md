### What I learned ###
- Understanding Single Responsibility principle
- Using tests to write only the code that is needed
- Creating a module (and removing it when I realised I can use a method)
- Seeding a random number during testing for consistent output
- Context blocks in my tests for defined states to test

## Left to Complete ##
- I'll not return to this project most likely, but this was a fun challenge to have to really think about testing behaviour rather than state.
- The tests all now are accurate and pass, however the code could do with a good old refactor.
- Readme is updated and the link added to my learning tracker.
