Week 1, Makers Academy â€“ Airport Challenge
====================

* Creating a program to manage planes landing and taking off at airports, using a TDD approach.

* Planes can land at an airport, and then take off, as long as the weather is not stormy (which is it 20% of the time)

* Planes cannot land if they have already landed, and cannot take off if they are already in the air

* Planes cannot take off from an airport unless they are already at that airport

* Tests written with RSpec

* Rubocop used to check Ruby syntax and conventions

* Test coverage is 100%

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

Things to remember:
-------
* Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance will make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.
* Note that is a practice 'tech test' of the kinds that employers use to screen developer applicants.  More detailed submission requirements/guidelines are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
