Airport Challenge
=================

This is our first challenge. We have been given a user story. We will try and emulate an airport, where we can land planes and let them take off. The airport has a capacity, and when the wether is stormy we must prevent landing.

Objectives

Understand Object oriented programming and test driven development.
