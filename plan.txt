This is a plan of my airport_challenge program.
The steps aren't necessarily in order.

1. Classes: plane, airport, weather
- Plane:
 -> take_off
 -> land
 -> confirm take_off (USE IN_AIR ARRAY)
 => in_air
 => in_airport
- Airport:
 -> full?
 => capacity
- Weather:
 -> stormy?
 => RAND & apply set values to stormy
