Airport Challenge 

This project is the weekly challenge of my third week at Makers Bootcamp. The main goal is to put into practice TDD and ensure good practice.

The aim of the challenge was to test drive the creation of a set of classes and methods to satisfy the user stories I was provided with.

I broke down the user stories following black-box planning to understand what the input and output of each story would be. 
 
Some of the challenges I faced relate to confirming when a plane is no longer at the airport, as well as wanting to move my stormy? method to a different class (Weather).
