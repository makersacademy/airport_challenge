AIRPORT CHALLENGE
-----------------

Installation
-------------
* git clone sara6 network address
* cd airport_challenge
* bundle install


Lib and spec set up
-------------------
* Airport
* Plane
* Weather
* Each of the above has a corresponding spec file. 


Description
-----------
* Started with each user story and worked out in turn
* Stunts and mock used to isolate tests


Difficulties
------------
* The weather user story 
* What to put in the weather spec 
* The weather tests in airport would make all other tests fail
* The above tests are commented out in airport_spec to make the others works
* Confusion on what belongs to airport and what belongs to a plane (i.e. landing and land)

Next steps
-----------
* Solving weather better 
* Looking up modules more, which suspect may help with weather user story 
* Understanding irb in a README
