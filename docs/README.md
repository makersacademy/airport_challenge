Steps Taken
-------

1. I created a diagram from the user story's so i knew which object and messages to created
2. Tested each object exist before creating
3. Tested code before created code
4. Passed test
5. commit

- I decided that weather method should be inside the airport as it is the weather of the airport.

- 100% test coverage
- Tests are passing 95% of the time. It would seem that the stubs i have put in are causing issues every now and then. I have used rspec bisect to drill down and find the error with the stub but i am unsure how to fix it.
