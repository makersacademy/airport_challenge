# Airport Challenge

The software will control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  It is based on user stories provided in the initial task at: https://github.com/meta-morpho-sys/airport_challenge/tree/master.

Before starting I run "bundle" to fetch any necessary gems for the current project.

## Steps taken so far:
1. Extrapolated the Domain Model from the user stories.
2. Created diagrams reflecting the Domain Model.
3. Implemented some features for the Airport, Weather, and Plane classes and tested them with feature and unit tests (irb, Rspec, Coverage and Rubocop).
4. Had great fun while doing all the above!
5. Unfortunately I didn't have the necessary time to complete, but I have some ideas.
