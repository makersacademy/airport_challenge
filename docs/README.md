Airport Challenge
=================

Approach
-------

1. I decided to create 3 classes of single responsibilty: Airport, Plane, Weather
2. I decided to create the Airport class first
3. I created an initializer so i can create the instance of the class with specific arguments
4. I decided to create the Plane class 
5. I created an isntance variable called landed_planes which is an empty array'
6. i created a method land_plane so i can push the plane landed in the array
7. i created takeoff_plane method to instruct a plane to take off and confirm that it is no longer in the airport
