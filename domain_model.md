OBJECTS AND MESSAGES

Plane <-- lands (if flying, and if not stormy and airport not full) --> Airport
Plane  <-- takes off (if in airport and not flying and not stormy) --> Airport
Airport to have default capacity that can be overridden

FEATURE TESTS

Feature 1: Land a plane in an airport DONE

plane = Plane.new       # Create a plane
airport = Airport.new   # Create an airport
airport.land(plane)     # Land the plane in the airport

Feature 2: Allow a plane to take off from an airport DONE

plane = Plane.new
airport = Airport.new
airport.takeoff(plane)

Feature 3: Airport has a default capacity DONE

airport = Airport.new
airport.capacity == described_class::DEFAULT_CAPACITY

Feature 4: You can change the airport's capacity DONE

airport = Airport.new
airport.capacity == described_class::DEFAULT_CAPACITY
airport.capacity = 15
airport.capacity (should return 15)

Feature 5: A plane cannot land if the airport is full DONE

airport = Airport.new
airport.capacity.times { airport.land(Plane.new) }
airport.full? (should equal true)
airport.land(Plane.new) (should raise error)

Feature 6: A plane cannot land unless it is flying DONE

plane = Plane.new
plane.flying?           # should equal to false
airport = Airport.new
airport.land(plane)     # should raise an error

Feature 7: A plane cannot take off unless it is on the ground (not flying) DONE

plane = Plane.new
airport = Airport.new
airport.takeoff(plane)
airport.takeoff(plane)  # should raise an error because the plane has taken off already

Feature 8: Plane responds to flying? DONE

plane = Plane.new
plane.flying            # should return false

Feature 9: If plane takes off, flying equals true DONE (although stub didn't work)

plane = Plane.new
airport = Airport.new
airport.takeoff(plane)
plane.flying?           # should return true

Feature 10: If plane lands, flying equals false DONE

plane = Plane.new
airport = Airport.new
airport.takeoff(plane)
plane.flying?           # should return true
airport.land(plane)
plane.flying?           # should return false

Feature 11: You can check the weather at the airport DONE (forced both sunny and stormy)
airport = Airport.new
airport.weather         # should return randomly sunny or stormy

Feature 12: A plane cannot land if the weather is stormy DONE

plane = Plane.new
airport = Airport.new
airport.takeoff(plane)
airport.weather = stormy
airport.land(plane)     # should raise an error "can't land plane in storm" or similar.

Feature 13: A plane cannot take off if the weather is stormy DONE

plane = Plane.new
airport = Airport.new
airport.weather = stormy
airport.takeoff(plane)  # should raise an error "can't take off in storm" or similar.

Feature 14: A plane is flying by default DONE

plane = Plane.new
plane.flying?           # should return true

Feature 15: If the plane lands, it should be confirmed that it's in the airport

plane = Plane.new
airport = Airport.new
airport.land(plane)
plane.in_airport?      # should return true

Feature 16: If the plane takes off, it should no longer be in the airport

plane = Plane.new
airport = Airport.new
airport.land(plane)
plane.in_airport?      # should return true
airport.takeoff(plane)
plane.in_airport?       # should return false

Feature 17: If the plane isn't in the airport, it can't take off

plane = Plane.new
airport = Airport.new
plane.flying = false
plane.in_airport?       # should return false
airport.takeoff(plane)  # should raise an error "can't take off as plane is not in the airport."

Feature 18: Planes that are flying can't be in an airport

plane = Plane.new
plane.in_airport?       # should return false as the plane is flying by default

Feature 19: Planes that are grounded cannot be flying

plane = Plane.new
plane.in_airport = true
plane.flying?           # should return false as plane is in an airport

Feature 20: When there are several planes grounded, you can instruct a specific plane to take off

plane = Plane.new
airport.land(plane)
plane2 = Plane.new
airport.land(plane2)
airport.takeoff(plane)  
airport.planes_on_ground.pop  # should return plane2 that landed first

Feature 21: You can retrieve a list of planes in the airport

Heathrow = Airport.new
Gatwick = Airport.new
plane1 = Plane.new
plane2 = Plane.new
Heathrow.land(plane1)
Gatwick.land(plane2)
Heathrow.list_planes      # should list all grounded planes

Feature 21: You cannot instruct a plane that's in a different airport to take off

Heathrow = Airport.new
Gatwick = Airport.new
plane1 = Plane.new
plane2 = Plane.new
Heathrow.land(plane1)
Gatwick.land(plane2)
Gatwick.takeoff(plane1)     # should fail because plane is not in the airport
