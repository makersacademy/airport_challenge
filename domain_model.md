Plane <-- lands (if flying) --> Airport
Plane <-- confirm landing --> Air traffic controller
Air traffic controller <-- instruct take off (unless stormy) --> Plane

Airport to have default capacity that can be overridden
FEATURE TESTS
Feature 1: Land a plane in an airport DONE
plane = Plane.new       # Create a plane
airport = Airport.new   # Create an airport
airport.land(plane)     # Land the plane in the airport
Feature 2: Allow a plane to take off from an airport
plane = Plane.new
airport = Airport.new
airport.takeoff(plane)
Feature 3: Airport has a default capacity
airport = Airport.new
airport.capacity == described_class::DEFAULT_CAPACITY
Feature 4: You can change the capacity
airport = Airport.new
airport.capacity == described_class::DEFAULT_CAPACITY
airport.capacity = 15
airport.capacity (should return 15)
