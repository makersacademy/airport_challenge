## **Airport Challenge Readme/Code Review Request - Ed Goold**
#### **6.1.2018 - Makers Academy (December 2017 Cohort)**

### **Summary**

I completed this challenge on an incremental basis, trying to stick as closely as possible to the red-green-refactor principles
on the basis of i) feature and then ii) unit tests in a failing/passing order, and then back and forth until (on my view)
the requirements from the client's User Stories were met.

In doing so I reviewed and consolidated on the work that we undertook in week 1 of the course, in particular focusing on RSpec
syntax and practice, which I felt was a weaker area compared to my (nascent) coding skills and therefore the side of the task
that merited the greater focus.  Of great help here was Ed Withers' advice (thanks!) from earlier in the week to take a much more
fulsome, descriptive approach to RSpec rather than trying to boil it down into difficult to understand (even for the writer/coder!)
pieces.

I found the challenge to be great fun and am writing this late on Saturday, having spent an enjoyable day and evening Ruby-ing.
My thanks to those who crafted the various components and pulled it all together, they did a great job and this has been the
highlight of the course so far for me.

### **Specific Areas Requested for Feedback**

I was disappointed to see that my test coverage was around the 89% mark and, further, that my code was assessed to be overly
complex.  On the second point in particular, I get the sense that there may have been far more efficient/elegant ways to approach
the problem, however I would have found it very difficult at this stage to hold that in my head as a priority while also
meeting the tight focus that we have been encouraged to adopt so far, in particular around breaking down the 
requirements into the smallest possible units of functionality.

Could you provide any specific pointers as to where I may have taken individual wrong steps there?

I am also aware that this is a general weakness with my problem solving skills and something that I am going to have to focus on
hard in the coming weeks.  If there any more general thoughts from specific errors that you can see which might help guide me
away from those pitfalls, I would be grateful to hear them?

Finally, any thoughts on the RSpec front would be great too.

Thanks again,

Ed Goold
