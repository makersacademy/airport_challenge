As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

We want to introduce a cap to how many planes can land. I have set this to a magic number 25

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

We want to introduce a capacity variable rather than magic numbers, that can be overwritten.

Create stormy? method that returns true 1 in x times.
If it is stormy, the take_off method should raise an error.

Same as above but land should raise an error if stormy.

Edge Cases

Planes that are already flying cannot take off, Planes that are landed cannot land again and should be in an airport.
