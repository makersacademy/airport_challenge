Was having real trouble trying to test whether the class responded to subject.New before realising that noine of the tests would work if the class didn't exist. Tried a few mthods to test whether the initialize method was working correctly but wasn't successful. May be barking up the wrong tree. I feel this is the sort of thing that could be sorted really quickly with a pair partner.
