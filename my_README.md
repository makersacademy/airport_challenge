## Natasha's Airport Challenge Readme ##

## My approach to the airport challenge
Perform the following steps for each user story:
1. Draw a diagram modelling the user story
2. Write a feature test in irb to test the story from the user's perspective
3. Write an rspec test to drive the development
4. Write code to pass the test
5. Check rspec, irb, rubocop. Fix any issues.
6. Commit and push
