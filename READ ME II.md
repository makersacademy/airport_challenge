## Approach to problem solving for this project

### User Stories
Throughout the challenge, I employed a test driven development approach to fulfil each user story to my fullest ability.
I found it helpful to use each user story directly into a user_story feature spec to better interpret the clients specifications for the project.  By doing this I was able to build my feature test from the user stories and then from there build out the spec test, which in turn developed the code.  

### TDD
I used the RED - YELLOW - GREEN method of failing, passing and refactoring the code, before moving on to the next user story.

### Test Errors
When I encountered test error, I used the method of 'tightening the loop' and gaining more visibility on each error to help solve them. Where I would then research common error or use the documentation to help find solutions.

### Partially Completed Project
As writing test is very new new to me with this being my first TDD individual project of this size, I did find that a lot of time was needed for me to gain contextual understanding of code, TDD and also interpreting user stories.  At this stage of my development, my focus is on learning rather than completing projects, if I am not gaining learning through them.  

The last user stories werenâ€™t completed:
User story 6
As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

### Going Forwards
Over the week, I plan to continue to learn through the project to complete the last user story. Especially having gained more experience writing tests during the week, this will help me to create a process to solve such challenges in the future.
