For the airport challenge I have completed all of the user requirements as I have interpreted them and all my tests pass. I have however not used doubles as I could not get my double for a plane with a landed => false to work in the rspec tests for Airport_spec.rb.
I took the approach of giving the weather a random number of 1-10 and said that 9 and 10 would represent stormy weather (only 20% of the time) as I think that was accurate representation of the amount of time it might be stormy.
Then, I assigned a landed attribute to the plane class which could be set to true/false depending on whether the plane was in the air or not.
Finally, I created a planes array to ensure that the plane could only take off/land from the same airport. 

I look forward to reviewing my code and seeing where it could be improved.

Thanks!
