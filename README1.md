I enjoyed this weekend challenge, but I found it difficult.

My thoughts behind why I found it difficult are as follows:

I picked up a basic understanding of RSPEC later than  during the week, and as a result I didn't get as far through the Boris Bike challenge as I would have liked. I think this resulted in more of an uphill battle with this weekend challenge.

My approach:

I tried to start things off very simply. This began with trying to build sensible domain models for the user requirements.

I built some unit tests for plane_spec.rb, and used feature tests to build and cross reference these.

I followed the challenge review file, and started to build out the tests, as well as the associated methods.

I struggled to put meaningful code in the methods, and as a result, the whole project became a bit disjointed. There was a point at which the tests overreached the methods and then I became a bit confused.

I have submitted what I hope will show some of my work and progress for what was almost a whole weekends worth of work.

I would plan to progress by fixing the errors in my airport_spec.rb file, and really try and nail down the responsibilities between the code in the various files.

If I had more time, I would work through boris bikes and the walkthroughs to gain a better understanding of that code, and how I might apply those principles to complete this project.
