Approach to solving challenge
======

- Create a functional representation of each User Story to extract the client's requirements. Store these in User-Stories.txt. ✅
- Use these requirements to write the first set of feature tests (which should fail). ✅
- Write a series of unit tests based on the client's requirements to ensure that all feature tests pass. ✅
- Refactor the code and ensure it conforms to the Rubocop style guide and SRP. ✅
- Submit a pull request.
