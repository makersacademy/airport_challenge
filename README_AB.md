*Airport Challenge (week 1, weekend challenge, 08/09-09/09)*

OVERVIEW

 I personally struggle with writing rspec tests, especially when it involves more than one class. Also, due to a time
constraint (I only had 5 spare hours to do the challenge) it was incredibly hard and resulted in completing only a half of it. 
 I am planning on completing the challenge during this week, and this of course includes making sure that it passes all the tests
 and is neat and elegant.
 
 APPROACH 
 
  I started with carefully reading the user stories to make sure I clearly understand the storyline. I then created a file in
   spec folder called "stories_spec.rb" where I pasted the stories and commented them out.   (to be continued......)
