As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination 
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

Plan:
I need 3 classes: passenger, airport and plane.


1.a create 3 testfiles

Passenger  <-- working? --> true/false
Airport  <-- working? --> true/false
Airport  <-- land(plane) --> working?
Plane  <-- working? --> true/false
Plane  <-- boarding(passenger) --> working?

1.b create 3 classes and 2 methods
- passenger
