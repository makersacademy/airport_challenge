Airport Challenge - comments
============================

Approach

Assessing the user stories, breaking them up to object and message.

Creating a file for each class that would be needed, as well as their respective spec files.

A feature test was written, which did basic functions of the program.

Most tests are quite simple, as I couldn't get the stub testing to work for weather and
other raised errors.

This is one thing I'll need to update.
