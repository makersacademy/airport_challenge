## Note these are just some guidelines!
## Feel free to write more tests!!

# A plane currently in the airport can be requested to take off.
#
# No more planes can be added to the airport, if it's full.
# It is up to you how many planes can land in the airport
# and how that is implemented.

# If the airport is full then no planes can land

scenario 'a plane can land'


 context 'traffic control' do

    xit 'a plane cannot land if the airport is full'

    # Include a weather condition.
    # The weather must be random and only have two states "sunny" or "stormy".
    # Try and take off a plane, but if the weather is stormy,
    # the plane can not take off and must remain in the airport.
    #
    # This will require stubbing to stop the random return of the weather.
    # If the airport has a weather condition of stormy,
    # the plane can not land, and must not be in the airport

  plane notes ## Note these are just some guidelines!
## Feel free to write more tests!!

# When we create a new plane, it should have a "flying" status,
# thus planes can not be created in the airport.
#
# When we land a plane at the airport, the plane in question should
# have its status changed to "landed"
#
# When the plane takes of from the airport, the plane's status
# should become "flying"

  xit 'has a flying status when in the air'

  xit 'can take off'

  xit 'changes its status to flying after taking off'
