I started by writing a basic test that required an 'Airport' class
This failed as the 'Airport' class had not been made yet
I then created the 'Airport' class and rerun the test which then passed

I then repeated this process for the 'Plane' class

I then wrote a test for airport.land(plane) so that I could land a plane at an airport
This test failed as i didnt have and airport method for 'land'
I then defined a method for land
the test then failed as the method didnt take the correct number of arguments
i then added a parameter to the land method
then the test failed as the actual and expected outputs didnt match, so i then wrote the land method to get the test to pass
Once the test was passing i refactored my code, and then run rubocop to ensure it was as simple as possible.
I then committed and pushed these changes to github

I then repeated the same process for airport.take_off

After i wrote a failing test to check for an error to be raised when the airport was full, i created an argument for airport.initialize so that the use could input a capacity, and i set this by default to 5. I then created a private method to check whether the number of planes at the airport was less than the capacity. I then used this private method ('full') in the airport.land method to either output an error or to land the plane (the same way i did it in the original  method). This code was refactored quite a lot and now reads a lot better.

As there is already a default capacity set, but can be changed as required, the next user requirement has also been completed.

After writing a failing test for weather, i created a new parameter for a new aiport and set it by default to sunny. I then made a private method to check if the weather was good, if it was is the plane can take off, if not an error is raised saying it is too stormy.
This will not be my final method as i will need to be able to randomise the weather instead of having it input when a new airport is made, but i used this to check my initial logic.

I then randomised the weather, and had to create a double in the test to allow for more consistent checking. However, when i completed this, it wasnt using the saved value in the test, so i had to make another class for weather. Then i re-wrote the code and tests and retested to see if the randomisation and doubles had work. Now they are all working.

'Magic number' for capacity removed and added into 'DEFAULT_CAPACITY'.
Weather strings changed to symbols.

Different classes split into different documents and incorporated into the documents that they are referenced in.

Tests grouped into different methods.
