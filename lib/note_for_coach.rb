# Note for coach to read:


# From reading the user stories, I can figure out how to split up the classes.
# But I don't understand how methods work within classes, or how to use methods
# or variables from one class in another class.
# e.g I don't understand how to use the results of a method from one class on an
# instance of another class.
# When there is more than one class involved, it doesn't make sense to me.
# I don't understand how to write tests for methods that contain code.
# I also don't understand how to write tests that involve methods from other clases.
# So I did what I could, although very basic.
