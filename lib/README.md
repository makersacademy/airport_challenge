# WEEK 1 - Airport Challenge

To build an Airport that controls the flow of air traffic.

## Getting Started

My lib and spec directories are in the main Airport_Challenge forked directory that I submitted. You should find a control_tower, plane and a weather_report .rb file in the lib directory and corresponding spec files in the spec directory.

### Prerequisites

I sent in a pull request that should show the five passes I made on the challenge. The fifth being the latest.

```
'fifth pass' was my final commit and push
```

## Running the tests

I created a comprehensive set of RSPEC tests for al the basic functions requested as well as all edge cases. I also did the bonus RSPEC test for landing and taking off multiple planes.

### REFLECTION

I enjoyed this challenge. While I managed to fulfill all the main user stories within a few hours, I found the edge cases caused me to review and improve much of my code.

```
1. Refactoring
2. Isolating responsibilities
3. Using doubles and mocks
4. Instance variables
5. Readability
```

### WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO IMPROVE

I felt that I can be better with using doubles and mocks. I also wanted to figure out how to improve the implementation of my weather checker methods. I would like to have more direct control over forcing returns on the weather within the framework of my CONTROL_TOWER method. I worked out a satisfactory way of testing the functionality, however, while all tests passed I believe this section can be improved.

Though I was very happy with the finished product, if I had more time...

```
1. Implement more direct user interaction. Maybe some kind of interface.
2. Improve my weather checker methods.
3. A better use and understanding of doubles and mocks.
4. Implement a more robust logging system for planes such as an array.
5. A way to prevent new airports or planes having the same name.
```
