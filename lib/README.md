For this challenge I got to a point where I implemented the basic airport requirements such as the hangar/planes array.
I also implemented a full? method that raises an error when there is a problem. I struggled with making the classes interact with each other and am still not comfortable when working with connected classes. 

I would continue this project by trying to include a test double for the airport's #stormy? random weather. I would also
like to look into how to connect classes e.g. calling the plane class method from within the airport class.
