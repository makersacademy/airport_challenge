## Airport Challenge
----------------------------------------------------

require "airport.rb"

require "plane.rb"

- I have created a file named 'airport_challenge_in_action' to show how the code methods were designed to be used.

- I used the boris_bikes challenge as a template for the code as the functionality was similar to what was needed from the airport and planes.
- On top of this I attempted to try and make the airport and planes unique so that you would have to specify a plane_id and airport_id when commanding landings and takeoffs.
- More work needs to be done on the tests and making the code pass.
