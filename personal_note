My thoughts and struggles with the first weekend challenge.

For this, the first weekend challenge, we had to create an airport app to practice test driven development. 

I started off by thinking about the different parameters that we should include into the app and how I could arrange them in the best way into separate classes or methods. I tried different ways.

I understand the goal of TDD and I am able to write basic tests in basic syntax. I tried, but struggled to write a test that would give me the chance to write the code the way I imagined it to be. In particular, I struggled to include the random selection of the weather, because writing a test that would cover both possibilities without throwing an error turned out to be really difficult. 

My goal for the next days is, to focus on starting of from the test side. Until now, I always had an idea of what the code should look like. If Iâ€™ll be able to switch that off, TDD would be easier.

That brings me to a thought I had while working on the challenge. I think that TDD is good  to secure the functionality of a program but it sets boundaries for creativity and spontaneity. But since these two things are not really necessary for a task like this it is probably a good thing.

My test and my code are far from finished. My test and my code are far from perfect. I am not satisfied with my work. I am not satisfied with the outcome of the last two days. I am not satisfied with the outcome of the last week. I will do better.
