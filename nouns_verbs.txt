Planes can take off and land when the weather is sunny
If it is stormy, no planes can land or take off

To get passengers to a destination 
Instruct plane -> land at airport

To get passengers on their way
Instruct plane -> take off form airport -> confirm to airport it is no longer there

To ensure safety
Prevent landing -> when airport is full

So it can apply to other airports
Default air capacity -> overrides when needed

To ensure safety
Prevent takeoff -> when weather is stormy

To ensure safety
Prevent landing -> weather stormy

To create weather
Random number -> rarely it will be stormy -> needs to be able to be overridden for testing

Defence against edge cases
Planes can only take off from airports they are in	
Planes that are already flying cannot take off/be in an airport
Planes that have landed cannot land again and must be in an airport
