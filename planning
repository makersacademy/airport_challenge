THE AIRPORT CHALLENGE PLAN - This document is my plan of the Airport challenge before programming it.

USER STORIES:

As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination 
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination 
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

MY PLAN:

In the user stories, there are 2 different people - Air traffic controller and system designer. They appear to centered around the design of the airport and planes.

My idea of having two classes - Airport and Plane, appears to fit in with the user stories as they are nouns. I would want those two classes to be split into two files separately for readability.

The methods are:

Land
Take off
Is airport full
Is weather stormy?

Constant variable:

Capacity - this can be changed as per the user story from the system designer
