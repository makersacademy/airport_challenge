Airport weekend challenge

It lands or allows planes to take off airport provided the weather is sunny

require the airport.rb and weather.rb files from lib directory

The rspec test are in the spec directory

It is not finished I would add guard conditions to the land and
take_off methods to prevent planes flying in bad weather.
I would also initialize airport class with an array give it a
default value and a method to change it if I wish.
