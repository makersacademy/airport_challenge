add tests to test edge cases:
- change how planes check status (do through airport, not plane) (method to check if plane still in airport and explicitly search for it in the private array)
- cannot take off planes if none there
- test weather output to improve test coverage in file
- only allow integer to be passed as argument for capacity. If not integer default to 10.
- can't lower capacity beyond current number of planes
