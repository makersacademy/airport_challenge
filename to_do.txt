add tests to test edge cases:
- test weather output to improve test coverage in file


done:
- cannot take off planes if none there
- cannot land if plane already there
- only allow integer to be passed as argument for capacity. If not integer default to 10.
- can't lower capacity beyond current number of planes
- remove methods and tests on plane

harder to do:
- make airport attributes private
