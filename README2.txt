I copied the user stories into a text document then made a note of the nouns and verbs, therefore the objects and methods, 
that I would need in order to meet the functionality. Then I created the necessary files.
I drafted some code in the sourcecode files, because I needed to know how I was implementing the user stories
in order to write good code for it. I then hashed this code out, wrote a test, saw it fail, unhashed the code,
and then re-worked the code until it passed. I repeated this, sometimes re-working the tests as well, especially
as the use of doubles means that one has to describe the functionality of a double before it can be tested, and
this functionality wasn't immediately obvious to me.

There was no need for modules or shared examples in my implementation.

I made use of rubocop at the end to tidy up code.
