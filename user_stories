I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 
# I need:

#   - To prevent (throw error) when attempts to land a plane at full airport are made ✅

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
# I need:
#   - To set a default capacity in initialization ✅
