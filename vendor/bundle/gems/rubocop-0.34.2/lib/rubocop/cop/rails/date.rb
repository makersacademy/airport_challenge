      # This cop checks for the correct use of Date methods,
      # such as Date.today, Date.current etc.
      #
      # Using Date.today is dangerous, because it doesn't know anything about
      # Rails time zone. You must use Time.zone.today instead.
      #
      # The cop also reports warnings when you are using 'to_time' method,
      # because it doesn't know about Rails time zone too.
      #
      # Two styles are supported for this cop. When EnforcedStyle is 'strict'
      # then the Date methods (today, current, yesterday, tomorrow)
      # are prohibited and the usage of both 'to_time'
      # and 'to_time_in_current_zone' is reported as warning.
      #
      # When EnforcedStyle is 'flexible' then only 'Date.today' is prohibited
      # and only 'to_time' is reported as warning.
      #
      # @example
      #   # no offense
      #   Time.zone.today
      #   Time.zone.today - 1.day
      #
      #   # acceptable
      #   Date.current
      #   Date.yesterday
      #
      #   # always reports offense
      #   Date.today
      #   date.to_time
      #
      #   # reports offense only when style is 'strict'
      #   date.to_time_in_current_zone
