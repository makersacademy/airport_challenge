This project has been made to ensure the safety of people travelling by plane between
airports. It's important to note that there must first be passengers travelling in the
plane, otherwise this exercise would serve little purpose. The plane will not be able to
land in an airport if the airport is full and it won't be able to take off from an empty
airport for obvious reasons. If there is stormy weather the plane will not be able to take
off or land, as that would be dangerous.
