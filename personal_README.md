# AIRPORT CHALLENGE

## Getting started
To clone the project repo
`git clone git@github.com:Benjamaker/airport_challenge.git`

## Technologies
Ruby

## Project Goals
To practice TDD and Object Oriented programming principles by building a virtual airport.

## Running tests
#### Unit tests
Rspec
Run `rspec` from the command line to run unit tests
#### Feature tests
NB: UPDATE THE FILES AND ADD HERE
- First we open irb from the command line and `require './lib/airport.rb'` in order to run the program.
- Below we see a new instance of Airport and Plane class instantiated. Plane(s) will be instantiated as `@flying = true` as default, as this seems to be the case in our first user story.
- When we try to call `take_off(plane)` on the airport, we get `RuntimeError (Airport empty, there are no planes!)` because there are no planes at the airport yet.
- When we call `airport.land_plane(plane)` however, we see that the plane is returned and the status of `@flying = false`

## User stories
```
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
