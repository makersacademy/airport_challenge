I found getting full coverage in my tests difficult and I am currently only at 90% coverage. I haven't got a test to check if a specific plane is at the airport or not -just weather there are or are not planes in the airport. I focused on writing tests for each individual user story but my tests do not cover edge cases such as checking if a plane exists in an airport before letting it take off.
