#  Airport Challemne

My initial approach was to only have one airport with planes coming in and out systemitacally. I soon realised that I failed to plan out the project properly and quickly ran into problems when thinking about multiple airports and planes status.

I learnt a massive amount about RSpec, in particular how doubles, mocks, stubs etc work interchangeably. The genral process of RED, GREEN and REFACTOR and why this is so important, has become very clear.

A couple things I would do differently if I was to try this challenge again, is make a proper plan/diagram for how the classes, methods and modules interact with eachother and also go into more detail with my feature tests. I did start and restart a few times which I shouldnt have because I later realised I was on the right track. Sam Morgan's youtube exemplar was a massive eye opener and showed me exactly where I was going wrong at times and where I could of done better moving forward.

All in all, a fantastic learning experience and can't wait for week 2 to further my knowledge.
