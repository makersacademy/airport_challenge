<h1>Airport Challenge</h1>
* I found this challenge really hard.
* I spent a lot of time (3-4 hours) trying to work out why my Git and GitHub weren't communicating with each other properly. After a lot of detective work (thanks @osc!) we realised that I'd forked the repo within a repo of the same name. Fixed!
* The first two user stories, I think I got to pass using very basic tests.
* When I got to work on the weather part of the challenge is where I've really come unstuck. I can't work out how to integrate it to the rest of the tests and code.
* Since adding the fail test, two of my tests that previously passed are now failing and I'm not sure how to fix them. I'm now at the point where I'm just trying anything to make them work which is probably not the right cool, calm and logical mindset to be in :-)
* I'm disappointed not to have to got to the end of this challenge, but I genuinely have put the hours in and I don't know how to move forwards from here. So probably as good a time as any to say I can't do this - YET - but I look forward to working it out next week.
