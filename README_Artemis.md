In order to solve the challenge I needed to further research, read and digest the following points:
- Difference between feature and unit tests
- What is OOP and why is the difference between a function and a method
- Further understanding of the use and syntax of built-in matchers in RSpec
- Meaning and use of attribute accessors
- What it means to set up default values and how to create them

Once the aforementioned were understood it was much easier to create a test and the corresponding code for each user story. I tried my best to keep both the tests and the code as short and clear as possible. I still find one liner tests more difficult to understand than block tests that allow a description in the beginning. 

In terms of the problem itself based on the users' stories I decided to create and airport class instead of an aeroplane class as most of the actions involved an airport object.
