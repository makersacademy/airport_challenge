# Airport Documentation

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

##Airport User Stories

//airport_full?

To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

//default_capacity(capacity)
As the system designer 
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
