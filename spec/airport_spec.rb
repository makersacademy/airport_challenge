require 'airport'

## Note these are just some guidelines!
## Feel free to write more tests!!

# A plane currently in the airport can be requested to take off.
#
# No more planes can be added to the airport, if it's full.
# It is up to you how many planes can land in the airport
# and how that is implemented.
#
# If the airport is full then no planes can land

# To-do
# -----
# I need to find a way to default the weather to sunny, and then set stormy?
# to true just for the context in which the severe weather's effect is being
# tested
