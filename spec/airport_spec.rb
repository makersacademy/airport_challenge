## Note these are just some guidelines!
## Feel free to write more tests!!

# A plane currently in the airport can be requested to take off.

# No more planes can be added to the airport, if it's full.
# It is up to you how many planes can land in the airport
# and how that is implemented.

# If the airport is full then no planes can land
