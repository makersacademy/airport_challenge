require 'weather'

# I wanted these tests to check the storm method was working randomly.
# However, I couldn't get the random element of tests to work. 
# I attempted to use Stubs and Kernels. But I just was learning this from YouTube / documentation. 

# RSpec.describe Weather do
#   # describe ".storm" do
#   #   it "20% chance of storm" do
#   #     testweather = Weather.new
#   #     let(:storm) { 5 }
#   #     expect(subject.storm).to eq("storm")
#   #     end

#   # #   it "80% chance of calm" do
#   # #     testweather = Weather.new
#   # #     allow(Kernel).to receive(:rand).return(4)
#   # #     expect(subject.storm).to eq("clear")
#   # #     end
