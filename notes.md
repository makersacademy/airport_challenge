## Edge cases

> To prevent weirdness  
> I would like the system to raise an error if take off is requested for a plane which is not at the airport

```
> airport = Airport.new(WeatherStation.new)
 => #<Airport...>
> plane = Plane.new
 => #<Plane...>
# whether the weather is good or bad...
> airport.clear_for_takeoff plane
RuntimeError ("That plane is not at that airport!")
```

---

> As the system designer  
> To prevent weirdness  
> I would like the system to raise an error if landing is requested for a plane which is already at an airport

```
> airport = Airport.new(WeatherStation.new)
 => #<Airport...>
> plane = Plane.new
 => #<Plane...>
# with good weather...
> airport.land plane
 => #<Airport...>
> airport.land plane
RuntimeError ("That plane is already on the ground!")
```

## Still to do

### Edge cases

- **DONE** Planes can only take off form the airport they're in
  - easy to check that @planes.include? plane inside Airport
- **DONE** Planes that are landed cannot land again
- Planes that are flying cannot take off/ planes that are not flying cannot land
  - `Plane` will need a `.flying?` predicate method or something?
- Planes that are flying cannot be in an airport/ planes that are not flying must be in an airport
  - Huh??
  - Maybe... `Plane` has `takeoff` and `land` methods which check whether it's in an airport before modifying the `flying` status, and throws an error if in an inconsistent state? Or that could be in `airport.land` / `airport.clear_for_takeoff`?
- etc.?
  - `airport.land` will only accept a `Plane` object somehow?
  - Anything else?
  - airport with zero capacity? negative capacity?

- the tests for `.clear_for_takeoff` depend on `.land`! should make these independent by... stubbing `airport.planes` or something?
- would it be better to directly add loads of planes to an airport somehow, rather than running `airport.land` over and over again? can do `airport.planes << plane`, but that doesn't seem a good idea in case `.plane` is made read-only in the future???
- we've got three possible errors at the start of the land method. should we write tests to make sure they come in the correct priority? e.g. at the moment if the weather is bad and the airport is also at capacity, the 'bad weather' error will fire. do we need to test that the 'airport full' error doesn't fire in that situation?
- `@airport.planes` should br private! 

### Refactor / code qualiy

- Read <https://github.com/Hives/airport_challenge/blob/master/docs/review.md> and compare against code
- Avoid vacuous tests - are any of the tests duplicates/redundant?

### $BONUS

- Write an RSpec [feature test](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/feature-specs/feature-spec) that lands and takes off a number of planes
