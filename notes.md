I completed the user stories. Possibly haven't touched all the edge cases but I did attempt to.

Realised at the end that my Plane class and plane_spec are close to useless.

I kept all my trial and errors in comments to look over later.

After I implemented the random weather, couldn't get any feature tests to work anymore as the results were random each time and I was unable to set the weather to be specific.

airport_spec.rb lacks DRYness, lots of repetition to keep the weather in certain ways for conditions to be fulfilled. Was unsure as to how to go around this.

Hopefully will be able to fix all issues in the coming week depending on what I learn.
