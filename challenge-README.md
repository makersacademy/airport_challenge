First, I planned out what exactly I want my code to do / achieve, based on the user stories.
This can be seen in the "plan.md" file. 

I then ran bundle to install RSpec.

Using TDD, I created the Plane class and the first method, whih reports whether a plane is flying in the air or grounded. I chose to begin with this, because it will influence whether planes can land in the airport or not. 

Having completed this, I moved next to the tests for the "land" method, which would convert a flying plane into a grounded plane.
