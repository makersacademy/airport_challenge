ABOUT:		This is a project/challenge set by the coding bootcamp Makers Academy and then completed by the AUTHOR as a learning assignment.

		Consequently, all scripts not included in the 'lib' or 'spec' directory are the work of the staff at Makers Academy.
		This README therefore only relates to these two directories. 

		The challenge is to build a simple air traffic control program that fulfils the following user stories:

		As an air traffic controller 
		So I can get passengers to a destination 
		I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport and confirm that it has landed 

		As an air traffic controller 
		So I can get passengers on the way to their destination 
		I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

		As an air traffic controller 
		To ensure safety 
		I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy 

		As an air traffic controller 
		To ensure safety 
		I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy 

		As an air traffic controller 
		To ensure safety 
		I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

		As the system designer
		So that the software can be used for many different airports
		I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
