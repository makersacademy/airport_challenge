As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

- plane.takeoff
@planes.pop()

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

- airport.weather?
   if sunny, then plane.takeoff
   else
   end

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy

4) airport.weather?
if stormy, then end

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

5) if @planes.size == DEFAULT_CAPACITY
raise ArguementError = airport is full


As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
