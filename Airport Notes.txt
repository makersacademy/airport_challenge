Boris Bikes project steps:

1. README.md
2. Diagram the user stories - nouns, verbs into Objects and Messages within a Table. Show communication between all players
3. Do feature tests for the initialisation of new objects of certain classes
4. Initialise RSpec within a project (google how to check whether rspec has already been initialised within a project or not. 
5. Create a new spec file for the object
	- Set up spec file to describe the object (e.g. plane) - Describe PLANE do /n end
	- Run spec to see resulting errors
6. Create a new file for the object class in the lib directory
	- define the class
	- require the right file inside your spec file 
7. Start IRB and require code files for specific classes (e.g. planes) 
	- set a variable (e.g. plane) to equal a new instance of the class (e.g. plane = Plane.new) in irb 
	- call a method you wish to use on that class on the variable (e.g. plane.land)
	- will be a feature error
8. Add a test to Rspec file that expects the object to respond to the method you desire (e.g., use ‘it’ to ensure the ‘plane’ will respond to ‘land’)
	- Run Rspec to check method
	- add the method to the class of the object (e.g. add method ‘land’ to plane class)
	- Run the Rspec
