My approach to solving this challenge was as follows. I read a user story. I turned that user story into a feature test. I turned the feature test into a unit test. I wrote code to pass the test. I tested, when it passed I committed. I looked to see if I could refactor it. On a change I tested again. Once it passed I committed. I then read another user story and so forth until I had completed all user stories. I ran rubucop to improve my code. I tested and committed after making each change rubucop suggest. I then went on to think about edge cases and write test for those. I checked my code would cope with them. I then wrote a test for dealing with landing and taking off of 5 planes which found an important flaw in my code. I fixed the flaw and committed.
