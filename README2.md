# Airport Challenge
The airport challenge is weekend challenge given by Makers Academy. The aim is to create a software that assists in controlling the flow of planes that land and take off from an airport.
Planes taking off from the airport is dependent on the random selection of weather. The software is built using TDD. ** Full requirements can be located in original README file**

# Approach to solving challenge
I decided to firstly look at the user stories and translate them into a domain model to have a clearer understanding of the objects and messages.

I then went on to complete the first and second user story, creating the spec file, carrying out the feature test and then going on to create the unit test for the classes and methods.
