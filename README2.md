The aim of this program is to create a system where planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. Allow planes to take off and land at the appropriate airports. Following the user stories airports also need the ability to stop planes from landing when the airport is full and during stormy weather.

Currently the program has the ability to allow planes to take off from the airport and return the status flying as true.
