First Weekly Challenge at Makers

Using concepts we have learnt throughout the course of the week, i.e TDD,Rspec, write software that controls the flow of traffic at an airport.

Based on the user stories, I have decided to create three classes each with their own methods

The Plane class will look at controlling the take off and landing of planes.
The Weather class will look at controlling landing and take off depending on the current weather.
The Airport class will look at managing the capacity of the airport and only landing planes if there is room.
