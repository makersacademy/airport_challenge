### Tristan Airport Challenge

## Approach

Mapped out user requirements into objects and messages. Identified Airport, Plane and Weather as classes.

Dealt with the specification requirements one at a time, introducing new methods to satisfy each new requirement. Used TDD approach by running a feature test, then creating a unit test, then creating the method, and dealing with each error as they came (no method -> no outcome etc.)

## Assumptions:
- weather only has 2 statuses, clear or stormy
- Confirmation to user that plane has left is met by stating plane has left and showing planes docked at Airport
