# Airport Challenge
The airport challenge is a 'Friday Challenge' set to test and try your knowledge of TDD, unit and feature testing.

## Description
The program should allow planes to take off and land in an airport. The planes cannot take off or land when the weather is stormy, but they can when it is sunny. A plane cannot take off if it is already flying or if there are no planes available in the airport. A plane cannot land if the airport is full. The capacity of the airport can change if specified.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
You will need to install bundle.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
This repo uses an SSH key with passphrase to commit changes. You must ask for permission from the owner if you want to add changes.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Thanks to Makers Academy for setting this challenge.

## License
Please ask permission from the owner of this repo.

## Project status
Project is not completly finished. With more time I would add features to check for multiple airports and check that the planes can only take off from the same airport they landed in. I would also add functionality to make sure the correct plane takes off from the airport, rather than just any.
