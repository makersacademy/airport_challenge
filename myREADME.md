Instructions
---------
You can run this program in irb.

```
$  irb
>> require "./lib/airport.rb"
=> true
>> require "./lib/plane.rb"
=> true
>> require "./lib/weather.rb"
=> true
>> airport = Airport.new
=> #<Airport:0x007fc2da84d358 @planes=[], @capacity=10, @weather=#<Weather:0x007fc2da84d330>>
>> plane = Plane.new
=> #<Plane:0x007fc2da8467d8>

```
To start the program require "./lib/airport.rb", "./lib/weather.rb" and "./lib/plane.rb" as shown above.

* To create an airport `airport = Airport.new` (default capacity of 10 planes)
* To create an airport `airport = Airport.new` (default capacity of 10 planes)
* To create a plane `plane = Plane.new`
* To land a plane `airport.land(plane)`
* To tell a plane to depart `airport.depart(plane)`

Airports cannot land or takeoff during stormy weather. The weather at an airport is determined using a random number generator (found in weather.rb).

Planes cannot depart from a different airport to the one it landed at.

Description
-----
Below are user stories I used to design this software:

```
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
```

Although the code implements all of the user stories it is still in beta.

The final release will be arriving in the near future.
