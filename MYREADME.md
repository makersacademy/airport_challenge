#Airport Challenge

##Author Laurence kite

We need to create and implement classes using a TDD approach for an fictional Airport.

This is done by following the spec and using the stories to guide  the Challenge

hopefully to completion.

##Brief Desciption of task
The main point of the program once completed is to simulate air traffic control from the point of view of an traffic controller who's job is primarily the safe landing and take off of planes from the airport.

They must ensure that these conditions are followed for the safety of all airport users:
Instruct a plane to land and be sure it has landed

Confirm plane is no longer at the airport after instructed to take off

 Prevent take off if the weather is stormy
 Prevent landing a plane at the airport if stormy
 Planes must not land if airport is full

 ### Software Flexibility###

 The software should set a default airport capacity that can be changed
 in order for it to be used by bigger or small airport, this also makes the software flexible should the airport expand. Also smaller airports can still use this modal.
