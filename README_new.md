In this challenge I attempted to have three objects.

Plane: containing only the instance variable 'location'

Weather: which would generate a random number between (1..10) (akin to beaufort scale)

Airport: containing two instance variables: capacity (set on initialization), and hanger (array to be populated with Plane instances)

airport also contains most of the methods that alter its own state and that of Plane instances.
